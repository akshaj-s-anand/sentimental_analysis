"I tested positive On Jan 16th. Body pain, fever and fatigue. The worst chest and back pain ever on upper left side. On Thursday chest pain is easing up a little but I'm coughing have green mucus and sore throat.  I actually ate a apple today after not eating the last couple of days. My taste is completely gone. My smell is gone but I can smell the cucumber juice I was drinking. I was able to take a shower today. Should I take this as me getting better or be worried that I'm not out of the danger zone. I'm still sweating really bad. This is the first time I have had covid. My husband tested positive on Jan 13th. He seems to be feeling better up on his feet the last 3 days but now seem to be getting tired and coughing alot. He does not have the chest pain that I have. I'm really scared. My 18 year old son lives with us but did not test positive. I pray that he does not get this.",Positive

"It might be sound weird, many people could take it as a joke but it is my two and a half decades experience of the hellish pain of pneumonia and inflammation. It is not a superstitious thing. It is a theory of Ayurveda and I strictly applied this thing upon myself for years . I used to face respiratory infections severely I have faced unending inflammation for decades, a small scratch on my body used to become a huge wound that took months to get treated. Now it's been three years I won't face neither pneumonia nor inflammation. A human body does take 11 to 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus and a human body is capable to beat covid 19 too, but it needs time, now what I am going to tell you, it is a natural way to avoid the over inflammation and pneumonia. When antibiotics stopped working and doctors had no cure. I followed this Ayurvedik theory. I have a very sensitive body and if I eat a thing that is slightly inflammatory, my body becomes sensitive and I either face  pneumonia or Inflammation severely and if I eat something fried, Highly acidic or spicy, my stomach gets  disturbed and I face diarrhea severely, it does take 10 to 12 days to get it treated, the doctors say that it is an another form of Inflammation or hypersensitivity of the intestines. And if I control my eating habits, I face no problem. It took me more than 20 years to sort out these foods. Apply the following diet plan for eighteen to twenty days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any sort of pneumonia and inflammation. This might be an alternative to treat over inflammation and pneumonia without any medication. 
Non - inflammatory food list 
1. All the meaty products [everything, like eggs,  pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc.(eat them  grilled or boiled or you can use  pure butter clarified to cook them )] . 
2. Oatmeal, Wheat and all the products that are made from pure, Oatmeal and wheat,( not biscuits, bread or cookies because they contain vegetables oil). 
3. Masoor dal. 
4. All the Dairy products (they must be made from pure animal milk like butter clarified,  curd, cheese, fresh milk ). 
5.  Turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt,tea, butter clarified. 
6. Because a human body needs vitamin  c, so to fulfil  this need you should eat Lemon, apricot, green or red chillis or connimon, these things are non inflammatory too. 
Note- many people think and they  have observed that the curd, white sugar and lemon are inflammatory things but I make you sure they aren't, because with the suggested diet plan ,  curd, white sugar and  lemon will never be inflammatory.  (curd, white sugar and lemon are not inflammatory things but when you eat something inflammatory, they act like catalyst.) 
The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit,dry fruit(except apricot),vegetable or vegetable oil, onion, garlic, ginger, green beans, green leaves(green leaves are slightly inflammatory) and all non suggested cereals , lentils and a little thing except the suggested diet may affect the whole result, so apply this thing strictly for eighteen to twenty days  and see the result by yourself. 
Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk with mixed apricot powder[ because animal milk doesn't contain vitamin' c'] (and search the history around you, an only breastfeeding child never gets pneumonia severely when I first got pneumonia I was three years old and I have searched this thing too. I didn't get a signal child who had  faced pneumonia under one year of age that been feeding only mother milk.) ( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil .
(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an ordinary person's body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst.)
(covid 19 is fetal for those patients whose body act overwhelmingly on covid 19 because if  someone's body doesn't act overwhelmingly, it's nothing but a different sort of comman cold for him  , so this is the diet plan if you follow this diet plan your body never act overwhelmingly on covid 19 and you are safe). For some patients Inflammation is a problem that won't have  a perfect cure since ages. Now I make you sure that you can control your worst inflammation problem by controlling your eating habits. You don't need to take a single antibiotic and asteroid but you need to control your eating habits very very strictly for 20 days and if you would do so your body never get over inflammation.(To understand this thing how covid 19 and other respiratory infections kills a patient search '' how covid 19 kills'' on YouTube channel *MED CRAM or NUCLEUS MEDICAL MEDIA ) 
Note : apply this diet plan strictly if you get affected otherwise eat everything what is healthy for you and wear a mask.
[last year a doctor uploaded a video on YouTube saying that she had applied this thing on her patients and she offered her patients a diet without containing glucose( mostly meaty foods) and on her surprise she got that covid 19 could not have survived for more than  four days in patients' body . I don't know why but that video was removed from YouTube after one and half hour later. YouTube also has removed my channel once too. It is my new channel please take a screen shot of this paragraph because this channel could be removed from the YouTube platform].🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱",Positive

"I'm on day 4 after the first symptoms hit.. It progressed so fast on the 1st day I went from jumping around to basically feeling super heavy and dizzy in 5 hours, before bed I got the jackpot confirmation on the test kit... when I was sleeping it was chills and fever in and out and sweating non stop while asleep.. Day 2 was basically full on headache, dizziness to a point I can barely walk straight, body ache, coughing, sore throat and my entire body felt super heavy, slept 18 hours and continuous Tylenol to try to mask the severity of the symptoms..  Day 3 I feel already kinda better but still need Tylenol to sleep, sore throat, headache, dizziness still present but doesn't hit as hard.. Now day 4, I feel basically 75% out of the gutter, no more need for Tylenol to get by and much more energetic, but still some sore throat, dizziness and headaches.. All those days I went through all had slight chest pressure, but nothing too crazy..  Drink a ton of water and tons of fresh fruits really helped with the soar throat, and also easier to eat as your appetite will probably be gone for a few days...  Same thing with mom in law, she's 64 and beat the virus in 4 days... wife is going through day 1 so her life is gonna suck for a couple of days ugh, and she seems like she's being hit harder with the symptoms =( ...

"I was feeling tired and a bit weak for 4 days and I had a long tiredsome shift at work. It came abrubtly for me the following day woke up with a fever, my heart pulse was around the 100 mark in bed and it's usually 65, severe eye pains, head pains were the worst.. delirium dreamining was unpleasant, i was worried that it was something worse than corona because my lungs and sinuses were completely fine and I had no sensitive throat, maybe a little dry only.. after my condition didn't improve after 7 hours I called for help and I got checked and tested.. Eventually later in the afternoon my temperature and heart rate normalized and my condition has greatly improved today, feeling a bit warm but not a fever, have short lived pains in my head but nothing severe, appetite still low..

My daughter and I tested positive. Thank goodness she is no longer showing symptoms after the first two days. But for me this has been the hardest week of my life other than giving childbirth. I went through all of these other than going to the hospital.

Then there’s the hot and cold flashes it’s weird your body is just out of control.

"I’m a waitress at Chili’s. I just tested positive for covid by doing a self home test. 

Day 1: I had a sore throat and mucus in my throat. I didn’t feel the best and head a head ache. I went home early from work.

Day 2: I had to take off a week from work. I slept from 11am-7pm with getting up every few hours to go to the bathroom or eating. I head a head ache most of the day. My body felt heavy and I felt dizzy. I laid in bed a lot. I had diarrhea. The sore throat is gone but I am starting to cough some mucus up which I think is good. I did have some nausea but I didn’t throat up. I had some pain in my lower back. I did have varying temperatures. Like the front of my legs were cold while the back were burning up. I don’t usually sweat alot unless I’m doing something at work but I was laying on my bed sweating then immediately I’d get cold. I have a slight runny nose. I think the worse thing today was just the headaches. 

Day 3: I feel so much better today. I still have a cough and my nose is running more, but I can actually stand and move around. That’s all the symptoms I have today. I don’t have a headache at all, thank god. 

Day 4: I feel pretty good today. I’m still having coughs and I have both a runny and stuff nose. I did have some head congestion when I first woke but it’s gone now I believe.

Day 5: just woke up. Have not had any coughs so far. My nose is a little runny and a little stuffy but that’s about it. I hope I got it out of my system. Now I needa try and take care of my partner who now has it.

Day 6: I felt great today. Only symptom was a cough. It wasn’t a bad one either. It happened only every now and then and I think it was because of mucus.
I’ll continue to update. I pray that I get better and that others who have it get better.",Positive

"Word of advice get a pot of hot water and place a spoon of Vicks and inhale the steam from your nose and exhale from your mouth this literally had me feeling better the next day it burns when I was inhaling the steam but it worked you can also do it with an ingredient my mother in-law taught me where you get a pot do the same thing but instead of Vicks you put a lemon (squeeze the lemon juice into the pot then throw it in there) throw orange peels not the whole orange, purple onion cut up, garlic (2-3 loves), and a cut up piece of ginger I make 2 pots , 1 to drink (big pot) I was drinking about 5-7 cups a day steaming hot it would burn my throat but it saved my life in my opinion everyone in my family was trying to get me to go to the hospital because I had it the worst they thought I would die but I did this religiously I was drinking the tea and doing the steam thing 3 times a day for 9 days I got covid again yesterday after 2 years of recovering the first time and this time it’s not really to bad I was feeling bad the first day but today I feel better I did the pot thing and drank 3 teas with some emergen-c and I feel a lot better today hope everyone is ok remember don’t let your thoughts get to you and don’t listen to all these videos my grandpa is in his 70s and be beat covid so you’ll be fine but if you happen to be in a severe situation with really bad symptoms do this remedy",Positive

"Tested positive to covid-19 4 days ago. 
So for me, It all started one morning, I had a massive headache quickly followed by a strong fever which went away in a matter of hours the same day. And the icing on the cake, had a runny nose as well.
I thought I had just caught a cold or something, didn't think much of it and when I woke up on day 2, I wasn't feeling that bad to be honest, even managed to workout but a couple hours later, my throat started itching all over and quickly, the itch turned into pain. At this point, I had taken stuff like Halls candy to make it more bearable, took Advil as well and Tylenol the day before for the fever. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, day 3 came...
It started with a nightmare, woke up suddenly and immediately knew that something was wrong, a second later, I swallowed. Let me tell you that it was so painful that it made me bend over in pain (pain level at around 15/10). Made it through the day somehow with medications.
On day 4, same thing as day 3, not much to say about it, runny nose, painful sore throat (level 12/10),  kept drinking hot green tea to stay hydrated.

I don't know about the rest of my day 4, I'll keep you guys updated. But I can only hope that it gets better during it or tomorrow. That's it for now, it's 4:28 AM and it's a living hell but it looks like I got used to it.",Negative

Unfortunately, this disease varies from person to person. And if you suddenly feel unwell, you need to see a doctor immediately. At first, the symptoms are similar to a cold, but by the 19th day this infection can lead to a serious condition and even death.

"Everyone is different and everyone heals in a different way. This is how I went from day 1-5 and rating it how bad it was from 0/10. 0 feeling good - 10 feeling terrible. This is how it went:

*Day #1:* Had a really bad fever. I was soaked with sweat. My clothes were hot too. Got headaches and leg aches which affects my walking. Couldn’t walk probably and my brain couldn’t function good because of the headache. Body was really tired so I didn’t do anything and slept a lot. Lost my appetite. It was a nightmare you don’t want to have. *9.5/10*

*Day #2* Felt a lot better. Can walk better. Body is not tired anymore. No more aches in my body. Headaches are fully gone. It was finally for me to do more stuff than day 1. But sore throat started to happen. Every time I swallow, my throat hurts. Made it difficult for me to eat or drink. It was not bad. *5.5/10*

*Day #3* Same as day 2. No headaches, aches in the body or body being tired. My throat got worse and I started to cough a lot. Couldn’t really eat because of it. I was tired that day so I took a nap - but overall, I’ll rate it a *6.4/10* 

*Day #4* Again, no headaches or aches nor fever. Sore throat got a bit better. My sense of smell & taste faded. Couldn’t smell unless if I’m really close. Couldn’t taste my food. I ate bagel and cream cheese and the cream cheese tasted like butter. It was a weird but interesting experience. I always wanted to know how people couldn’t taste or smell. *4.5/10*

*Day #5* I felt pretty normal. Sore throat started to get better but I started to sneeze a lot. Probably more than 20 sneezes that day. Got a stuffy nose (which is the worst). Couldn’t breathe through my nose because of it so I have to breathe through my mouth which I hate that idea. 

A few days after that, I felt a lot better. The stuffy nose slowly faded about and my throat don’t hurt anymore, just left me with a raspy voice.

"Currently in the middle of it so I will describe my symptoms for the people who are interested. Thursday the 21st of april 2022 I had my first symptoms, I was immediately coughing, pains in the chest and feeling tightness in my chest. I was convinced I had covid, because it felt different. Tested negative 2 times. Friday my throat was so painful. I was doubting myself and was hopeful that it might be the flu. Again tested negative. Friday night - Saturday I had a very high fever and started having hallucinations. Saturday I was mostly tired because I didn't sleep a lot. I was coughing again (not really bad), I felt cold, tired, my chest hurt and was overall just done with it haha! My lymph nodes were swollen. But again tested negative. Sunday I started coughing a lot, couldn't catch my breath, lymph nodes hurt, but also my lungs, the muscles around my ribs started to hurt and felt over all like shit. Tested positive. Monday (today) I am tired, I have sore muscles from coughing, my body hurts, coughing a lot, sneezing and getting a cold. Again overall feel really bad and I am in desperate need of new netflix shows to binge... 

Side note: I am 21, female, not overweight, have heart disease and had asthma as a kid. Was very covid safe, but a family member didn't care enough.",Negative

I guess she was wrong then. She thinks I’m over reacting when I am crying that it really hurts with bad headaches, so I don’t think she would take me to the hospital if I asked?

"Are you a Covid-survivor + Long Hauler?
Have you been clinically diagnosed as a mild or moderate case of covid-19?



Chuan here, a Covid Long Hauler turned researcher.

[A Little background: 7 months since contracting covid, despite having visited multiple doctors, specialist with no medical signs of pneumonia, perfect Lung X-ray scans, ECG reading, normal blood test, I still experience pains around my upper chest, neck, legs, basically all around my body (although with lesser frequency and intensity), besides difficulty breathing when wearing a normal surgical mask and occasional chest pains throughout some days. That said, what's hopeful for me is I have recovered my sense of smell and taste, getting better sleep and energy, subsided gastrointestinal issues and better cognitive concentration.]

The study I’m conducting is to investigate how covid-19 patients have been coping mentally with the infection and long term symptoms of covid-19. The specific population group of this study is clinically diagnosed as either mild or moderate patients of covid-19.

This study will help us understand better what is the impact of covid-19 on the largest group of covid-19 populations post Covid that’s currently largely dismissed by healthcare professionals and understudied in the literature.

We, the scientific community, could surely use your help to help more people (especially healthcare professionals) understand what is actually going on with the mental wellbeing of mild to moderate Long Covid patients!

If you met the research criteria detailed below & volunteer to be a part of this, feel free to take this short questionnaire below!

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTYySm6MPfQHDvsrzWP4eP_JnOtFfCI1WEsKTWKD-_nlMLA/viewform

Research criteria:
-Clinically diagnosed as mild to moderate case of covid-19 
-Tested negative for Covid-19 during recovery 
-Experiencing at least one of the common long covid symptoms 
-Aged 18-64, Free from any clinical diagnosis of psychological disorder

(Note: If you agree to take part in this study, your participation will consist of an online survey; assessment of your current symptoms and psychological assessment.

Today in my opinion is day 4, the first two days I felt the my throat was sore but it was very little, no pain no nothing, at first I thought it was because I talked a lot in those two days. anyways day 3 my throat was and it hurt in the morning then I suddenly felt fatigue and got chills at night. day 4 my throat is still sore I have a cough but when I cough mucus comes out, I tried to get the mucus out but it's hard to do so, my chills got much better. The thing is if I do a covid test, in my country it takes up to 3 days for the result to come out, it sucks. Anyways I haven't left the house ever since I felt that my throat was sore, so hopefully it gets better.

"To Free Med Education, I like your cartoon videos about COVID.  Just wondering if you are able to do one about SMOKING OR VAPING AND COVID.  I believe there is some very strong evidence that smoking either cigarette or vaping (not sure about vaping), that those who do smoke can pass on COVID and affect peoples lungs more at a easier rate.  My concern for those who do smoke, not judging them, are actually putting other peoples health's at risk and those who do ""contract COVID"" and are smokers can actually pass on the virus with the cigarette smoke smell, which then can turn into droplets, and passing the smoke smell to others in society and contracting COVID this way. 
I do want to say this, if people in this world truly want to love and respect one another lives and people's health's in this world, please stop smoking or do smoke where others won't smell the cigarette smoke.  This COVID virus will be around until Christ comes back, but I please urge you, PLEASE IF YOU LIGHT UP, PLEASE INSTILL IN YOUR HEAD, NEXT TIME I TAKE A CIGARETTE, WHO WILL I INFECT NEXT?

"I got the covid worse part is day 3-4 your body shuts down you can feel your body trying to fight but all your muscle is weak your mind literally gives up and just let the process go-ahead take over the body. 

I gave in and accepted death because that was how it felt woke up on day 6th all I could say was it was not time to go and thank father above. 

I force a lot of water and food even though it tastes like cardboard. Aleve was my best friend the headache is bad   

So if you have the covid force yourself to eat and drink water if you smoke cigarettes quit after you recover from covid because it Triggers the covid

Finally I was taken to the doctor, he said I must leave urgently for the covid19 test, they were closed and I ended up going the following day. Turns out when I almost fainted with a high fever of 40degrees, I was rushed to the hospital and tests were done, they said there was alot of fluids on my chest, I was put on the oxygen machine for the next 2 and half days. It was Sunday morning, the doctor came in and asked me how was I doing, I replied not so well, my body was completely in pain, my headache was extremely painful and my chest felt that I couldn't breathe at all, if I didn't have the machine on me. It was then she told, I was diagnosed with Covid19 pneumonia. I was a severe case. It took me a complete 4 weeks to recover alone, the only way I had contact with family was through my phone.

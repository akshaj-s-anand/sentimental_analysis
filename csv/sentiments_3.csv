I believe that it’s real my grandma has pneumonia she’s wondering why the pneumonia hasn’t gone away yet. They say she has pneumonia but they’re saying she doesn’t have coronavirus. What bothers me is that American doctors and hospitals and healthcare people care less than other countries! It does feel like the Bible end of days apocalypse or the beginning of it! The kind of chaos that we have today could actually bring the true antichrist to this world. Because he supposed to be a false hope leader and we all heard the stories. Maybe these are not stories anymore maybe this is real prophecy. In America google YouTube Facebook they’re deleting important videos that show doctors saying that all we need to do is increase the immune system and for some reason they’re choosing to delete those things and they’re pushing vaccination!

"It might be sound weird, many people could take it as a joke but it is my two and a half decades experience of the hellish pain of pneumonia and inflammation. It is not a superstitious thing. It is a theory of Ayurveda and I strictly applied this thing upon myself for years . I used to face respiratory infections severely I have faced unending inflammation for decades, a small scratch on my body used to become a huge wound that took months to get treated. Now it's been three years I won't face neither pneumonia nor inflammation. A human body does take 11 to 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus and a human body is capable to beat covid 19 too, but it needs time, now what I am going to tell you, it is a natural way to avoid the over inflammation and pneumonia. When antibiotics stopped working and doctors had no cure. I followed this Ayurvedik theory. I have a very sensitive body and if I eat a thing that is slightly inflammatory, my body becomes sensitive and I either face  pneumonia or Inflammation severely and if I eat something fried, Highly acidic or spicy, my stomach gets  disturbed and I face diarrhea severely, it does take 10 to 12 days to get it treated, the doctors say that it is an another form of Inflammation or hypersensitivity of the intestines. And if I control my eating habits, I face no problem. It took me more than 20 years to sort out these foods. Apply the following diet plan for eighteen to twenty days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any sort of pneumonia and inflammation. This might be an alternative to treat over inflammation and pneumonia without any medication. 
Non - inflammatory food list 
1. All the meaty products [everything, like eggs,  pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc.(eat them  grilled or boiled or you can use  pure butter clarified to cook them )] . 
2. Oatmeal, Wheat and all the products that are made from pure, Oatmeal and wheat,( not biscuits, bread or cookies because they contain vegetables oil). 
3. Masoor dal. 
4. All the Dairy products (they must be made from pure animal milk like butter clarified,  curd, cheese, fresh milk ). 
5.  Turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt,tea, butter clarified. 
6. Because a human body needs vitamin  c, so to fulfil  this need you should eat Lemon, apricot, green or red chillis or connimon, these things are non inflammatory too. 
Note- many people think and they  have observed that the curd, white sugar and lemon are inflammatory things but I make you sure they aren't, because with the suggested diet plan ,  curd, white sugar and  lemon will never be inflammatory.  (curd, white sugar and lemon are not inflammatory things but when you eat something inflammatory, they act like catalyst.) 
The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit,dry fruit(except apricot),vegetable or vegetable oil, onion, garlic, ginger, green beans, green leaves(green leaves are slightly inflammatory) and all non suggested cereals , lentils and a little thing except the suggested diet may affect the whole result, so apply this thing strictly for eighteen to twenty days  and see the result by yourself. 
Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk with mixed apricot powder[ because animal milk doesn't contain vitamin' c'] (and search the history around you, an only breastfeeding child never gets pneumonia severely when I first got pneumonia I was three years old and I have searched this thing too. I didn't get a signal child who had  faced pneumonia under one year of age that been feeding only mother milk.) ( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil .
(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an ordinary person's body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst.)
(covid 19 is fetal for those patients whose body act overwhelmingly on covid 19 because if  someone's body doesn't act overwhelmingly, it's nothing but a different sort of comman cold for him  , so this is the diet plan if you follow this diet plan your body never act overwhelmingly on covid 19 and you are safe). For some patients Inflammation is a problem that won't have  a perfect cure since ages. Now I make you sure that you can control your worst inflammation problem by controlling your eating habits. You don't need to take a single antibiotic and asteroid but you need to control your eating habits very very strictly for 20 days and if you would do so your body never get over inflammation.(To understand this thing how covid 19 and other respiratory infections kills a patient search '' how covid 19 kills'' on YouTube channel *MED CRAM or NUCLEUS MEDICAL MEDIA ) 
Note : apply this diet plan strictly if you get affected otherwise eat everything what is healthy for you and wear a mask.
[last year a doctor uploaded a video on YouTube saying that she had applied this thing on her patients and she offered her patients a diet without containing glucose( mostly meaty foods) and on her surprise she got that covid 19 could not have survived for more than  four days in patients' body . I don't know why but that video was removed from YouTube after one and half hour later. YouTube also has removed my channel once too. It is my new channel please take a screen shot of this paragraph because this channel could be removed from the YouTube platform].🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱",Positive

"I'm on day 4 after the first symptoms hit.. It progressed so fast on the 1st day I went from jumping around to basically feeling super heavy and dizzy in 5 hours, before bed I got the jackpot confirmation on the test kit... when I was sleeping it was chills and fever in and out and sweating non stop while asleep.. Day 2 was basically full on headache, dizziness to a point I can barely walk straight, body ache, coughing, sore throat and my entire body felt super heavy, slept 18 hours and continuous Tylenol to try to mask the severity of the symptoms..  Day 3 I feel already kinda better but still need Tylenol to sleep, sore throat, headache, dizziness still present but doesn't hit as hard.. Now day 4, I feel basically 75% out of the gutter, no more need for Tylenol to get by and much more energetic, but still some sore throat, dizziness and headaches.. All those days I went through all had slight chest pressure, but nothing too crazy..  Drink a ton of water and tons of fresh fruits really helped with the soar throat, and also easier to eat as your appetite will probably be gone for a few days...  Same thing with mom in law, she's 64 and beat the virus in 4 days... wife is going through day 1 so her life is gonna suck for a couple of days ugh, and she seems like she's being hit harder with the symptoms =( ... With all that said, I hope non of you have to go through this, cuz this is unpleasant as F ... stay healthy yall",Positive

"I’m a waitress at Chili’s. I just tested positive for covid by doing a self home test. 

Day 1: I had a sore throat and mucus in my throat. I didn’t feel the best and head a head ache. I went home early from work.

Day 2: I had to take off a week from work. I slept from 11am-7pm with getting up every few hours to go to the bathroom or eating. I head a head ache most of the day. My body felt heavy and I felt dizzy. I laid in bed a lot. I had diarrhea. The sore throat is gone but I am starting to cough some mucus up which I think is good. I did have some nausea but I didn’t throat up. I had some pain in my lower back. I did have varying temperatures. Like the front of my legs were cold while the back were burning up. I don’t usually sweat alot unless I’m doing something at work but I was laying on my bed sweating then immediately I’d get cold. I have a slight runny nose. I think the worse thing today was just the headaches. 

Day 3: I feel so much better today. I still have a cough and my nose is running more, but I can actually stand and move around. That’s all the symptoms I have today. I don’t have a headache at all, thank god. 

Day 4: I feel pretty good today. I’m still having coughs and I have both a runny and stuff nose. I did have some head congestion when I first woke but it’s gone now I believe.

Day 5: just woke up. Have not had any coughs so far. My nose is a little runny and a little stuffy but that’s about it. I hope I got it out of my system. Now I needa try and take care of my partner who now has it.

Day 6: I felt great today. Only symptom was a cough. It wasn’t a bad one either. It happened only every now and then and I think it was because of mucus.
I’ll continue to update. I pray that I get better and that others who have it get better.",Positive

"Word of advice get a pot of hot water and place a spoon of Vicks and inhale the steam from your nose and exhale from your mouth this literally had me feeling better the next day it burns when I was inhaling the steam but it worked you can also do it with an ingredient my mother in-law taught me where you get a pot do the same thing but instead of Vicks you put a lemon (squeeze the lemon juice into the pot then throw it in there) throw orange peels not the whole orange, purple onion cut up, garlic (2-3 loves), and a cut up piece of ginger I make 2 pots , 1 to drink (big pot) I was drinking about 5-7 cups a day steaming hot it would burn my throat but it saved my life in my opinion everyone in my family was trying to get me to go to the hospital because I had it the worst they thought I would die but I did this religiously I was drinking the tea and doing the steam thing 3 times a day for 9 days I got covid again yesterday after 2 years of recovering the first time and this time it’s not really to bad I was feeling bad the first day but today I feel better I did the pot thing and drank 3 teas with some emergen-c and I feel a lot better today hope everyone is ok remember don’t let your thoughts get to you and don’t listen to all these videos my grandpa is in his 70s and be beat covid so you’ll be fine but if you happen to be in a severe situation with really bad symptoms do this remedy",Positive

"Tested positive to covid-19 4 days ago. 
So for me, It all started one morning, I had a massive headache quickly followed by a strong fever which went away in a matter of hours the same day. And the icing on the cake, had a runny nose as well.
I thought I had just caught a cold or something, didn't think much of it and when I woke up on day 2, I wasn't feeling that bad to be honest, even managed to workout but a couple hours later, my throat started itching all over and quickly, the itch turned into pain. At this point, I had taken stuff like Halls candy to make it more bearable, took Advil as well and Tylenol the day before for the fever. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, day 3 came...
It started with a nightmare, woke up suddenly and immediately knew that something was wrong, a second later, I swallowed. Let me tell you that it was so painful that it made me bend over in pain (pain level at around 15/10). Made it through the day somehow with medications.
On day 4, same thing as day 3, not much to say about it, runny nose, painful sore throat (level 12/10),  kept drinking hot green tea to stay hydrated.

I don't know about the rest of my day 4, I'll keep you guys updated. But I can only hope that it gets better during it or tomorrow. That's it for now, it's 4:28 AM and it's a living hell but it looks like I got used to it.",Negative

"9)This video provides information on how to correctly identify the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Details are given about the symptoms of coronavirus infection from the 1st to the 22nd day. Unfortunately, this disease varies from person to person. And if you suddenly feel unwell, you need to see a doctor immediately. At first, the symptoms are similar to a cold, but by the 19th day this infection can lead to a serious condition and even death. In conclusion, I would like to say that I think this video is very informative and useful, because COVID-19 is a very common, very serious and very dangerous disease, which, unfortunately, is still relevant today.",Negative

First of all, if you feel unwell, contact your doctor so that you are given an accurate diagnosis and prescribed the right treatment.Symptoms are divided into 1-22 days.

"Everyone is different and everyone heals in a different way. This is how I went from day 1-5 and rating it how bad it was from 0/10. 0 feeling good - 10 feeling terrible. This is how it went:

*Day #1:* Had a really bad fever. I was soaked with sweat. My clothes were hot too. Got headaches and leg aches which affects my walking. Couldn’t walk probably and my brain couldn’t function good because of the headache. Body was really tired so I didn’t do anything and slept a lot. Lost my appetite. It was a nightmare you don’t want to have. *9.5/10*

*Day #2* Felt a lot better. Can walk better. Body is not tired anymore. No more aches in my body. Headaches are fully gone. It was finally for me to do more stuff than day 1. But sore throat started to happen. Every time I swallow, my throat hurts. Made it difficult for me to eat or drink. It was not bad. *5.5/10*

*Day #3* Same as day 2. No headaches, aches in the body or body being tired. My throat got worse and I started to cough a lot. Couldn’t really eat because of it. I was tired that day so I took a nap - but overall, I’ll rate it a *6.4/10* 

*Day #4* Again, no headaches or aches nor fever. Sore throat got a bit better. My sense of smell & taste faded. Couldn’t smell unless if I’m really close. Couldn’t taste my food. I ate bagel and cream cheese and the cream cheese tasted like butter. It was a weird but interesting experience. I always wanted to know how people couldn’t taste or smell. *4.5/10*

*Day #5* I felt pretty normal. Sore throat started to get better but I started to sneeze a lot. Probably more than 20 sneezes that day. Got a stuffy nose (which is the worst). Couldn’t breathe through my nose because of it so I have to breathe through my mouth which I hate that idea. 

A few days after that, I felt a lot better. The stuffy nose slowly faded about and my throat don’t hurt anymore, just left me with a raspy voice.

"Currently in the middle of it so I will describe my symptoms for the people who are interested. Thursday the 21st of april 2022 I had my first symptoms, I was immediately coughing, pains in the chest and feeling tightness in my chest. I was convinced I had covid, because it felt different. Tested negative 2 times. Friday my throat was so painful. I was doubting myself and was hopeful that it might be the flu. Again tested negative. Friday night - Saturday I had a very high fever and started having hallucinations. Saturday I was mostly tired because I didn't sleep a lot. I was coughing again (not really bad), I felt cold, tired, my chest hurt and was overall just done with it haha! My lymph nodes were swollen. But again tested negative. Sunday I started coughing a lot, couldn't catch my breath, lymph nodes hurt, but also my lungs, the muscles around my ribs started to hurt and felt over all like shit. Tested positive. Monday (today) I am tired, I have sore muscles from coughing, my body hurts, coughing a lot, sneezing and getting a cold.

"Are you a Covid-survivor + Long Hauler?
Have you been clinically diagnosed as a mild or moderate case of covid-19?



Chuan here, a Covid Long Hauler turned researcher.

[A Little background: 7 months since contracting covid, despite having visited multiple doctors, specialist with no medical signs of pneumonia, perfect Lung X-ray scans, ECG reading, normal blood test, I still experience pains around my upper chest, neck, legs, basically all around my body (although with lesser frequency and intensity), besides difficulty breathing when wearing a normal surgical mask and occasional chest pains throughout some days. That said, what's hopeful for me is I have recovered my sense of smell and taste, getting better sleep and energy, subsided gastrointestinal issues and better cognitive concentration.]

The study I’m conducting is to investigate how covid-19 patients have been coping mentally with the infection and long term symptoms of covid-19. The specific population group of this study is clinically diagnosed as either mild or moderate patients of covid-19.

This study will help us understand better what is the impact of covid-19 on the largest group of covid-19 populations post Covid that’s currently largely dismissed by healthcare professionals and understudied in the literature.

We, the scientific community, could surely use your help to help more people (especially healthcare professionals) understand what is actually going on with the mental wellbeing of mild to moderate Long Covid patients!

If you met the research criteria detailed below & volunteer to be a part of this, feel free to take this short questionnaire below!

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTYySm6MPfQHDvsrzWP4eP_JnOtFfCI1WEsKTWKD-_nlMLA/viewform

Research criteria:
-Clinically diagnosed as mild to moderate case of covid-19 
-Tested negative for Covid-19 during recovery 
-Experiencing at least one of the common long covid symptoms 
-Aged 18-64, Free from any clinical diagnosis of psychological disorder

(Note: If you agree to take part in this study, your participation will consist of an online survey; assessment of your current symptoms and psychological assessment. Participation in this study will not take longer than 5-10mins).

"To Free Med Education, I like your cartoon videos about COVID.  Just wondering if you are able to do one about SMOKING OR VAPING AND COVID.  I believe there is some very strong evidence that smoking either cigarette or vaping (not sure about vaping), that those who do smoke can pass on COVID and affect peoples lungs more at a easier rate.  My concern for those who do smoke, not judging them, are actually putting other peoples health's at risk and those who do ""contract COVID"" and are smokers can actually pass on the virus with the cigarette smoke smell, which then can turn into droplets, and passing the smoke smell to others in society and contracting COVID this way. 
I do want to say this, if people in this world truly want to love and respect one another lives and people's health's in this world, please stop smoking or do smoke where others won't smell the cigarette smoke.  This COVID virus will be around until Christ comes back, but I please urge you, PLEASE IF YOU LIGHT UP, PLEASE INSTILL IN YOUR HEAD, NEXT TIME I TAKE A CIGARETTE, WHO WILL I INFECT NEXT?

Finally I was taken to the doctor, he said I must leave urgently for the covid19 test, they were closed and I ended up going the following day. Turns out when I almost fainted with a high fever of 40degrees, I was rushed to the hospital and tests were done, they said there was alot of fluids on my chest, I was put on the oxygen machine for the next 2 and half days. It was Sunday morning, the doctor came in and asked me how was I doing, I replied not so well, my body was completely in pain, my headache was extremely painful and my chest felt that I couldn't breathe at all, if I didn't have the machine on me. It was then she told, I was diagnosed with Covid19 pneumonia. I was a severe case. It took me a complete 4 weeks to recover alone, the only way I had contact with family was through my phone.

She waited until I got a positive to get checked please keep my family in your prayers I guess the 4 of us are on day 5! Our 3 year old completely back to normal thank God!!

"Pestilences is on the rise folks. The Bible foretold that sickness and disease would increase in the last days...Friends, it's evident we are living in the last days.... Pestilences is unstoppable by man,  as the scripture in Jeremiah 10:23 states, ""it does not belong to man to even direct his step"" 
Man has been trying to elimate sickness since the dawn of humanity with no permanent solution or long term success. What does this tell us? These things can only be irradiated by means of God's Kingdom. This kingdom will soon take action against the troubles of man and husher in a new way of life for all of obedient mankind. Revelation 21:4 states, "" God will wipe out every tear from their eyes, death will be no more, neither will mourning, nor outcry, nor pain be anymore, the former things have passed away.""

Here, the Bible highlights the conditions to come under God's Kingdom arrangement. Can you imagine a time without sickness or death?  It will be amazing not to worry about such things as covid-19 ever again. That time will come, Isaiah 33:24 says, no resident will say, I am sick""... That means no more epidemics or earth wide Pandemics on this earth.  Corona virus!! history!!!! 

 Without sickness or death, Psalms 37:29 gives us a true glimpse into our future..
""The righteous will possess the earth, And they will live forever on it.""
We  can live forever, here on this earth without the fear of death or sickness.... This will truly be a paradise....We have much to look forward to in the near future...What God promises comes to be, he cannot lie as written in Titus 1:2-""and is based on a hope of the everlasting life that God, who cannot lie, promised long ago;""

We can be assured that a bright future lies a head..

So...I ask again, how can the mask possibly do any good unless, as I was trained by Maha, the mask has to make a seal to the face.  Men have to be clean shaven, women, no makeup, a little vaseline maybe to seal around the mask. NO CLOTH MASK !!!  THEY WILL NOT SEAL.  THIS IS ALL A HOAX,  no biohazard receptical anywhere.

"i know this is a year old but my symptoms were VERY different. i remember it started off with me feeling super tired but i felt fine. i ended up falling back asleep and woke up to a text saying my brother was covid positive. the next day, i slept almost all day. had the craziest dreams. i felt weak but was still able to eat and drink. the next day is when it started to feel like a sinus infection. it hurt when i looked up or down with my eyes. i still felt weak but still ate. temperature was good. the days following, my smell started to get weak but also things started smelling different. i remember my mother’s cooking smelled so bad like chemicals or clorox wipes. it bothered me so much that i had to leave the room. a day before my text results is when my temperature spiked from 97.9 to 100.3. from there on, it kept rising. i was fatigued, couldn’t sleep, and suffering from extreme panic and anxiety. the day i got my results was the day my brother was taken to the ER. cough came in a week later and i started to feel really weird. almost like i wasn’t alive anymore. my temperature reached 103.7. i started coughing up bloody mucus. i remember it being so dark red (it was scary!) had crazy diarrhea! it was basically just liquid, like water!

sadly, i ended up going to the ER. my oxygen levels were at 86. nails were blue. i remember feeling comfortable at the ER and being so scared at the same time. seeing my mother walk out the doors, i prayed to Jesus to give me another chance at life. i stayed in the hospital for a week. my brother ended up leaving midway through my stay. he recovered well. 

HOSPITAL STAY—————
the hospital stay was so bad since i was still suffering from the virus. i got these random sweats during the day. not night sweats but almost like drunk sweats. my skin was clammy and moist—i get these when i’m drunk. my oxygen levels dribbled around from 93-95. the more it stayed at a higher number, the more the nurses would lower my oxygen (sign of recovering). my heart rate was crazy high! i would get up to use the commode and it would reach 150.",Negative

"HOW I SURVIVED... It was mid February when I first heard about covid. I just been in Portland days earlier. I saw something on the Internet a school closing in Oregon. And some deaths in Washington.  I wondered but like most i thought na nah.  In the back of my mind.. could be.. then  I read about Tom Hanks symptoms.  There were no Mask be found anywhere. The only place you could be tested was the hospitals. If you call them you were told don't come up in here unless ur on a stretcher.  I was on my own. I knew that  pneumonia was what killed you with something like this. I had already had pneumonia twice which made me more susceptible. The only question now was I going to die from this alone in my truck.  I bought some material from Walmart make my own mask. Still in disbelief that this was actually real that this was actually happening.  Trump was saying it's all a hoax.  7 years earlier I had spent 5 days in my truck alone on antibiotics recovering from pneumonia. I knew if I come down with pneumonia this time there would be no antibiotics. So .. I had to do everything I could to keep from coming down with pheumonia.  The first symptom I felt as though I was coming down with something. But when I felt my forehead there was no fever I was just clammy it went away. True to form 5 days later it started. I kept the medicine bag in my truck I went into action. At night I took half a dose of Mucinex PM. To keep my lungs clear at night.  In the morning I would  take a brisk walk and do forced coughing to clear my lungs. I said to myself ( take to your bed ur dead ) you have to keep moving no matter what... All the while thinking surely this isn't happening it all seemed surreal. During the day I would take half a dose of Mucinex daytime. at 5 p. M. I would eat a decent sized meal. Then  at 9 p. M. I would drink a cup of. Dieter's tee. Which is a mild laxative. This cleaned out my system of all the phlegm that had the virus in it ...that I had  swallowed  during the day and that night. This way It   wasn't incubating in my digestive system 
. An old black women taught me this trick years ago. I did this every night for 5 nights...I ate fresh garlic and took oil of oregano. Both help keep the lungs clear.  I did forced coughing once an hour weather I felt like I needed to cough or not. Just keep my lungs clear.
In five days it was pretty much over. But I felt like crap for a month. 6 months later I came down with a milder version. At least I think so there was nowhere to get a test. If I had it since I was never aware of it. And I'm not sure if I had it then there is really no way of knowing it. After a month had gone by I called Red Cross. Asked them if they would want to use my blood to immunize those with the same blood type. I might as well been talking to a three year old.
I don't understand all the fear. And the need for all the strange medications. I truly feel that most people circum to this virus because they take to their beds thinking that's the way to get better. Or to take some type of weird drug.  I'm not a doctor my advice is to keep moving and keep your lungs clear. The worst of it only lasts about 5 days. Of course that's my experience. I hope this helps someone.  The key to surviving covid to me is not to come down with pneumonia. In my opinion. Question will all these weird drugs prevent pneumonia. If not why are you taking them. if you've been infected with covid and you're not experiencing flue cold symptoms then your body dealing with it appropriately. You shouldn't need to take Medications. In my opinion.  If you come down with covid-19. Keep moving, keep your lungs clear, and whatever you do don't take to your bed. I am in my 60's I don't understand why this advice hasn't been out there from the beginning. I post this message and go back and it's gone for some reason. Why?",Positive

Exhaustion, loss of appetite, almost fainting at times, overheating, sore throat, disoriented, difficulty breathing, sensitivity to light and sound. After those two days, symptoms begin to subside and you slowly get better. It does not last 20+ days.",Positive

"i really do hate this video, it made me fear for the next day, i never suffered from most of these side effects... day 11 i was rushed to hospital with blood oxygen saturation on 61% and dropping, i feared more for my life due to this video.... i ended up on oxygen, with nurses injecting a giant syringe  of what they called dynamite, which was a medication to break down blood clots in my legs, i had a heart beat 126+ heart beats per minute, i lost feeling in my left hand. i suffered oxygen starvation to my brain, i have forgotten a few things... i was finally released from hospital, my heart still beats to fast if i stop my heart meds my heart will shoot back up to +125 bpm, i still do not have my sense of smell or taste back, i only recently started getting feeling back in my hand..... i contracted covid going on 4 months now.... i will give you a little advice... get an oxy meter.... if your blood oxygen saturation gets lower than 85% go to hospital..... it drops rapidly from there..... once it gets lower it puts strain on your heart, organs and my lead to oxygen starvation... on my way out the hospital the doctor said I'm lucky to be alive..... 4 people died in hospital in the ward i was in, in 3 days.... good luck to anyone that contracts covid, i hope you are as lucky as i am to be alive.....",Positive

"Covid is strange because my symptoms did not start this way.. I woke up with a bad cough that wouldn’t go away and I started to feel worse as the day went on. By time I went to bed, I had a cough, chills, dizziness, and extreme fatigue- my fever went to 102 in just a couple hours. I spent the next four days in bed with a wet cough and a fever that varied between 100 and 102.5- I was extremely dizzy, fatigued, and no appetite. It was around day 6 where I started to feel some minor chest discomfort.. the fever subsided but I was coughing so hard that I was spitting up bloody mucus. It wasn’t until around day 9 to 11 where I felt better and started to get my energy back. It was around day 17 when the cough calmed down and the fatigue was gone. 
My partner had all gastrointestinal symptoms- couldn’t hold down any food or water for several days and had a fever that went well over 103 for over eight days. His symptoms were barely manageable, and it took him well over two weeks to recover. I’m so thankful that we both recovered and are doing well.. I know people who weren’t as lucky and my thoughts and prayers are for everyone who’s had complications with this virus.
If you’re currently going through COVID- stay hydrated, rest, and do breathing exercises to keep your lungs open.",Negative

"Just wanted to comment. It's been 6 days since i tested Covid positive. Although it started off mild the one thing that has been absolutely excruciating is the lower back pain. Utter agony with it. I haven't been vaccinated and was in the mindset of its like flu... I can assure anyone sceptical (like i was) that there was likely not much too it that there definitely is. This is nothing like anything I've had before. There are so many symptoms as well as the ones you see most of. The lack of taste and smell is much harder to deal with than you may imagine. When you already feel very weak and then you can't taste anything you start to avoid eating anything. It's a bad vicious circle. For me personally, the worst of all has been this back pain especially last night when i coughed, heard a loud pop and passed out from the pain. I can only assume i have popped a disc back in to place as today the whole back pain has eased. If you feel anything, trust me, you will definitely know when you have it, just please take it easy and stay away from people. Keep biscuits or other sweet things in your house.... You can sense the sweetness but not taste it and its the only things I've managed to eat in 6 days. That and fresh orange juice. For anyone just thinking it's like any other bug.... It's really not.",Negative

"Looking at these symptoms which I have passed as mild sore throat and cough up to 1-2 days and not progressing to other stages in day 3-4 I conclude that: The Racial Stock of Humanity has been weakened tremendeously!!!
Due to Lack of physical exercise, lack of movement of the joints, muscles, lung muscles, heart muscles, lack of breathing fresh clean air in all major metropolitan centers all over the world, lack of consuming high organic protein diet, milk rich in vitamin d + d3 that helps immunity and organic or grass fed meat etc etc. I walk 8-10 + km a day in the mountains and breath fresh air. All these foods maintain a healthy strong blood plasma rich in all vitamins and proteins which protects very well against any disease. Also poor breeding of human race, women and man marry not based on physical/sexual attraction but on material interests. So their descendants become weaker and weaker. This Coronavirus it is just the start of what is coming, with global warming many more viruses will come much more deadly. Humanity faces a very bleak future due to overpopulation and mis breeding.",Positive

"My dad is 73 and is currently in the ICU. He’s traveled all around the world over the last 50 years, picking up all kinds of viruses, and he’s never been sick like this. This virus is murderous and relentless. It is flat out trying to kill him. He was running a high fever since day 2 and I knew from everything I’ve read he was headed for a severe case. By day 5 he was in the ER with pneumonia, sent home after IV fluids. They should’ve given him steroids but they didn’t. Then again on day 8, same thing. Then on day 9, just this Tuesday, his pulse ox dropped to 54 at home! He was about to be intubated and put on a ventilator but his O2 levels responded very well to 100% oxygen. He got stabilized and avoided the ventilator. He was knocking on heaven’s door that day. I was the one who took his pulse ox reading and called the ambulance. It was probably the scariest moment of my life. He was shaking uncontrollably, panting like an overheated dog and couldn’t talk in complete sentences. I kept telling him he has to fight and he can’t give up yet and he just kept saying “I’m sorry. I tried. I tried. It’s so hard.” I felt helpless and hopeless. I thought he was going to die within minutes or hours. Today he is doing remarkably better. ICU nurses are telling him he’s doing the best of all the Covid patients. Sadly he is the only Covid patient in ICU who is not on a ventilator. My heart aches for those people and their families. I can only hope and pray they pull through. This is the real deal. Me, my wife and our two kids just recently recovered from Covid Delta variant with only mild symptoms. We were lucky. There’s no rhyme or reason as to who gets a severe case. A very young man at our church just lost his mom and SISTER to Covid. She had to be in her 20’s or 30’s. Please be safe everyone. Take vitamin D and zinc and stay hydrated. Even the FDA says it can help strengthen your immune system.",Positive

"I had Covid-19 in August 2021.

Day 1 - Extremely mild sore throat. Barely noticed it. 
Day 2 - Fatigue, malaise, and mild fever set in. Felt like shit
Day 3 - Fever has worsened to about 100 F. Fatigue, aches, chills, headaches common when fever present. Symptoms on and off. 
Day 4 - Severe fatigue and a 101.4 fever. No energy, moderate aches, chills, headache, bad diarrhea. Felt HORRIBLE.
Day 5 - Symptoms getting slightly better. Fever down to 100.5. Still immense fatigue, aches, diarrhea. Woke up sweaty as hell.
Day 6 - Fever nearly gone, max temp 99. All symptoms improving, but still present. Woke up sweaty again.
Day 7 - Fever gone without aid of tylenol or ibuprofen. Mild fatigue, and aches. Diarrhea still present. Feel back to 80% normal.
Day 8 - Symptoms are 95% gone, but developed a moderate dry cough. 
Day 9 - Day 18 - All symptoms are gone except cough. Occasional seemingly random coughing fit. Feel back to normal.

When I had covid I have no symptoms at day just at night I don't know why!! And I never loss the smell or the olfhat.,Neutral
So could more so likely be you have a  cold or allergies or asthma or bronchitis! Why does the body aches happen! Well apparently with covid they just do! On the other side could just have an itchy cough! Right! And ichy cough is also know as a recurring coughing right been the case forever! Now when you cough you tense your muscles right! Could be falling asleep have a quick itchy cough you turn the wrong angle! Now shit hurts on that side right! Same thing happens when you lift weights wrong! So now we need to assume lifting weights wrong or sleeping in a position following a heavy turn and cough cannot in any way Injure you! It now has to be covid! Also a 93 year old man claims ache and pain hard time breathing! Can't be because of all the illnesses in his lifetime it has to be this one all of the sudden! Nevermind the fact he has had a cold or pneumonia it can't be those it's covid for sure. Serial killer strangled!well he had a hard time breathing so that a covid death everybody!

"I had covid last March 28 but i never experience fever on 5-6 .. in my case, it first started with a sore throat and i feel i need to replace my toothbrush because mythroat is really itchy then few hours later.. i had runny nose.. very transparent mucus coming out on my nose... then hours later (night) i shiver.  Feel so cold like want to be near the fire place because its so cold and im having fever .. my fever 37° last for more than 8 hours. I drink a lot of liquids and anti flu medications.. it went down but the headache and some muscle pain still there.. then on 5th day i feel my breath is so slow not too well even if im not moving at all. And it comes with episodes like sudden shortness of breath usually occurs every after  5-6 hours and my remedy is drinking lot of water. Then i wanna add during the days i experienced runny nose (1-2nd day) my nose really hurt bad for 2 minutes like i felt there's sand feeling inside my nose.. then my sense of smell were out. And after the fever on 3rd day my sense of taste went down.. but thank God im healed now what an experience!!!

Day 2 was the first time i noticed a fever of around 100.8. breathing was fine other than a mild cough forming. Day 3 was the first bad day with major nausea, body aches and chills with a 101.3 fever. I took tylenol every 6 hours and it always brought my fever down to 98.8 until the 6 hour mark and then would get high again. Day 4 felt like a better day with no nausea or body aches. I still had a fever, managing it with meds every 6 hours. I heard most people lost their fever by day 4 so i started to worry a bit. Day 5 was still a high fever when i woke up and chills. I got up and took my multivitamins (I was taking vitamins everyday since the start.) I didn't eat or drink before and i took all the vitamins, and 4 tylenol and my body went through a huge panic attack. It felt like my body was shutting down.

I have thrown up many many times I've been put on multiple IVs as well as been shot with Benadryl and flu shots. I've never had to take so much medication in my life I feel like a senior citizen at a senior home. I'm 33 I'm Wellfit I play soccer I lift I stay active I was exposed to someone who had it and had to go on a 5-day quarantine it wasn't until the sixth day when I started showing symptoms. It's hard to breath, it's hard to focus. Everything is sore This covid likes to play tricks on you he wants to make you feel like you're getting better when you have a 98-degree and then it shoots up as the day goes on. It's like your body tries to find out what the hell is happening or where it's at. Sadly my wife who has cancer and is doing chemo as well as pregnant and about to welcome our girl by mid next week has it too one of my two boys has it but I'm so thankful that none of them have gone through what I have. I'm not going to say it's the worst sickness ever but it definitely is annoying and lingering. We definitely were people that took precautions and wore masks but of course you'll always have those coworkers that don't even believe in it when they get it you are in the path. My advice to you is doing A FUCK ton of liquids from gaterade to body armor to liquid iv to tonic water. And eat!!!! Even if it's apple sause saltine crackers or soup. If you throw up you have a window to at least absorb something. Get out side, covid wants to keep you in the dark, we are plants we need energy, sun. Walk when you can covid wants to keep you still. You need to have a mind body connection. Your body is trying to fight and so should you.your constantly playing catch up. I pray for everyone good speed.",Positive

Käisin arsti juures ja nad tegid palju vereanalüüse, siis öeldi, et mul on herpes.  Minu arst ütles mulle, et herpese vastu ei saa ravimit. Ma tundsin ennast halvasti, otsisin Internetist võimalikku herpese viiruse ravi, nägin dr Amenze'i, rohuteadlase postitust, kes aitab inimestel end HIV-st ravida, HEPATIIT B, VÄHK jne.  Võtsin temaga ühendust ja rääkisin talle, kuidas ma end tunnen.  Ta ütles, et tema taimsed ravimid võivad mind ravida.  Ta saatis mulle ravimid ja ma sain ravimid kätte paar päeva pärast tema saatmist, võtsin ravimid tema määratud viisil.  Enne ravimi võtmist sümptomid lakkasid.  Käisin arsti juures ja tegin veel ühe vereanalüüsi, üllatavalt negatiivne.  Teil pole enam mingeid sümptomeid.  Dr Amenze on suurepärane ja tema ravimtaimel pole kõrvaltoimeid.

"The greatest eerie is that you have to be alone, I personally dont want anyone in my family to worry so I detach myself out to different town and live with the covid alone. I manage to survive till this day, it is my 10th day of positive of covid.

Scary how I'd twice tested negative but 3 days later i took a test again and I positive but the symptoms started 3 days after and that was so much awful. It is like regular cold but something wrong with the chill. It feels like your body cant hold yourself anymore, you can collapse anytime if you dont take a rest immediately. Days after you will loose ur taste and smell completely but still can tell if the food is sour, sweet, or salty. Another weirdness, you will have GERD and make you completely cant swallow any food unless it's bitter cracker, ginger soup, drinking ice water. That's it because you basically wanna throw up everytime. Now I'm in the stage of difficult in breathing. I hope I'll be okay and I hope everyone who's positive right are okay and soon be negative again, and immune to the symptoms because those are worst. Stay safe everyone!",Negative

"Hi Namaste🙏 to all.

 Now  few words I am remembering to all world. 



What is medicine & where is medicine & how is medicine & why is medicine to all world . 

what's Pharmacology( Now a days running only Drug related Pharmacology & where is food related cology) , where is pharmacology, why& how is Pharmacology required to all world. 

Pharmacology means Pharcokinetics( How All Drug's Passes through oral route ,Intra venous & intra muscular routes-Absorption,Distribution metabolism & Elimination&Pharmacodynamics(the branch of pharmacology concerned with the effects of drugs and the mechanism of their action). 

Now a days All medicines making through pharma companies & releases more air pollution to all areas spoiled Nature life,All Humans(Through Clinical trials (Phase-1, 2,3,4)& animals life( Through Preclinical trials), Birds life& land life. 


Medicine is so bad in 1823 & Medicine is a one type of chemical substance not a food 🍲 product. 



Since 50 years (From 1970 Onwords till now) all doctors treated repots not patients. 

What doctors don't get study in medical school. 

All doctors don't never try to make money in the sickroom. 

In all doctors when the mind is not in the brain how can you run all our body organs.. All doctors have finished bachelor's of medicine& bachelor of science. 

Medical scare system is a million dollars business & it creates more customers spoiled all life. 

Chemical drugs damages all our body organs.. 

Where is world former organization & world culture , nature organization.

Finally at what time all hospitals will go to strike at least one year& all of them will become near to nature definitely all is always well with lovely enjoyment.

Sorry but COVID isn’t a virus at all it’s a extension of 5g they use the power of 5g and COVID to kill you 5g is bad cause it has to be closer to work and it’s radioactive but it’s also in our phones and tablets and COVID 19 is merely not a virus but a thing that can get into your system through 5g so I guess we have to stop 5g but it’s just not what is happening it will keep being here for a while and I mean it’s so dangerous that people are taking down some of the towers cause of how bad it is the vaccine is just poison and also why are no one talking about the flu anymore didn’t it kill so many people yet it’s all covid so in my opinion do not get 5g or the shot unless you just want to kill yourselves and if not we’ll your smart thanks for reading though not a lot of people know about this and it needs to be more well known!,Negative

The 1st world countries of the world are committing horrible acts in the world pandemic. 3rd world countries like India are struggling while the richer countries have access to vaccines so much that they're starting to vaccinate children of various age groups. What happened to vaccinating the Frontliners such as nurses of which a large sum of come from countries such as the Philippines? How come America is quick to jump into an arm conflict but turns their back on the world when a pandemic strikes? Help the countries that need it most. United together and fight our common enemy. If you're feeling sick stay home wash your hands keep distancing  I hope that you feel better so that the world can feel better. #Actionsworsethanhitler,Positive

Day 1: I had congestion and a runny nose.
Day 2: I still had a runny nose and I felt really tired. I had a mild fever and my throat felt tickly.
Day 3: The fatigue was gone and I felt very lively. But I still had a runny nose and the tickly feeling in my throat. At some times, I cough but there was no phlegm.
Day 4: Runny nose and tickly throat is still present and the cough with no phlegm is now more often. There's also this feeling that I'm short in breath, but I don't if this is really real or I'm just getting paranoid. 😟

 Utilice la mayor cantidad posible de vitamina C natural para fortalecer su sistema inmunológico.

 Además,

 El virus actualmente no contiene vacuna, no puedo mentir, no hay tratamiento específico

 Desafortunadamente, debido a la mutación genética que lo hizo muy peligroso

 Esta enfermedad parece ser causada por la fusión de genes en una serpiente y un murciélago, y ha adquirido la capacidad de infectar a los mamíferos, incluidos los humanos.

♡~ Should I Cover My Face In The Presence Of My YAH?

""For a man ought not to have his ""HEAD COVERED"", since he is the image and glory of Elohim ; but the woman is the glory of man""
1 Cor. 11:7 

Here the word ""covered"" is the Greek word 'kat-ak-al-oop'-to'. And it means ""to veil or cover one's self."" 
The Linguistic meaning is ""NOT TO COVER OR VEIL [mask] YOUR FACE!"" 
Why??

Because Genesis 1:26 says you are created in ""His  IMAGE According To His LIKENESS.""
Adam was created without a ""veil or cover"" on his entire ""image"" much less his face!.

For anyone to cover His/Her face means that 
he/she is ""grieving YAH's Spirit by not listening to His voice.""

Moses came down the mountain of YAH without a ""veil"" (mask) and he was reflecting ""The Righteousness of Yahshua"" how did the Israelites respond? 

We are suppose to reflect ""His Righteousness"" and it should be ""self evident in our faces"" but if we choose to ""veil [mask] our faces"" what are we telling YAH ?

The Priests (the 'kohens') in YAH's Sanctuary wore a ""turban on their heads to signify ""the purity of Yahshua entire mind"" a  golden ban with a written statement  ""Holiness To YAH."" Was to be worn on the frontage of their ""mind.""
BUT NEVER WAS A VEIL OR COVER (mask) WAS TO BE ON THEIR FACES!""

""Moses NEVER WORE A VEIL WHILE TALKING TO OUR YAH!"" [Exod.34: 33-35, It would be a death wish if he did]. He wore a veil because of the ""unbelief"" of the people, but took it off when he went back up the mountain to speak with Our YAH ""face to face!""

Look around how many choose not to reflect ""The Image And Likeness Of Their Creator, especially when they to YAH's Temple.""

And the devil laughs and speaks to his demons!
""Behold are these the ones that will take our place?.despicable humans!!""

It is sad how many of YAH's people will compromise and will come up with every 'insignificant excuse' on why they cover their faces. 

""But You are a ""Chosen Generation a 'ROYAL  PRIESTHOOD' a
holy nation His own special people tha
t you may proclaim the ""virtues"" of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light"" 
[1 Peter 1:9].

We have a choice to make! 

May YAH be with His people!

"If you love Jesus Christ avoid the Covid-19 vaccine. This is a command. Those who take the vaccine are seperated from God for all eternity. They have destroyed the image of God within them. All experimental lab rats have died from the vaccine. Those who take the vaccine shall surely die. The vaccine was created by Globalist. They desire to depopulate the planet. Bill Gates doesn't love you. He wants you dead. He is a very evil man. If he doesn't repent in time, I will deal with him. 

Seek Jesus Christ while the doors of mercy close. He is coming to rapture millions of Christians and children. The Lord looks absolutely nothing like the famous pictures. If you seek Him you will find Him. God is faithful to His promises. He loves and cares for everyone.

I find no pleasure in the death of sinners. It's not God's will that anyone perish, but all repent to receive eternal life. I desire to see many of you transformed into the image of Christ, and all for His Glory. I desire to seeany of you in God's kingdom. 

If you're willing, now is the time to repent and prepare for the return of the King. Everything written in the book of revelation will be fulfilled. This is the end.",Positive

"CANCER and infection (corona) TREATMENT: -
Local mediators in the cell core
A- primary mediators: -
Histamine, proteases-kinase, tryptase-and chemotactic factors-ecf <eosinophil and NCF neutrophil chemotactic factor
B-PAF (platelet activating factor) and arachidonic acid system products (such as exanoids, prostglandins and thromboxaneA2) are the best examples.
B-sequencing mediators
In inflammatory cells, peptide cytokines (interlokines) produced over the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi after exposure to the antigen are also regarded as interferons as sequencing mediators.
All of these in the nuclei of blood cells
If we cut these nuclei and injected their fluids into the blood.
If we do, all blood cells become a single function (cleanser). If we load Rh, the systemic mediators also come and the cancer cells disappear (work in rabbits) The dose is one drop
Getting rid of obesity, obesity caused ??? diseases can also be completely cured
Testosterone + Rh >> kc = Gluconeogenesis (chlorine delivery) this method is more suitable

 YOUR (LUCKING) TREATMENT?: -
{Testosterone + Rh infusion into the hypothalamus} + {Ayaka maximum dos (CSF) infusion}

"I was writing a eye opener but it was too long and whats the fucking point, people too gullable and believe the system so i give you a small taste of truth!  Even so called phd proffessions are clueless been lied too from the start or do they know we are lab rats meant to be tested and killed even doctor fauchi stated thiers a 0.1 chance of dying but he screwed up by spilling the beans at Medical Conference and notes online retracted. As for university graduates wow you numpties really buy into the system teachings and conditionings dont you, yano whatever your told, taught, watch must be true if its on a video or in text, because anyone with a brain would question this even do real homework. I half expect brains to come forward and realise the truth but i guess not, thats how society as become too far gone, too programmed, too hunan conditioned, too blind too see. Thiers a saying 'out with the old, in with the new' thats whats in full affect and happening right here and the quote can mean a variety of things but in todays world, it means out with the ""Old World Order"" and in with the ""New World Order"". This also means out with the ""Old Generation"" and in with the ""New Generation"". Terms of control, a new shift in society but what thier endgame is, yes it be hard to track now because its funny in the same year they quickly built up 5g towers during lockdown but also kicked in censorship act even companies behind this scamdemic, in the west and east have changed name even logo especially in shadow government. What im try get at is, they have designed a nano particulate synthetic to infiltrate our temples meaning the body, this inturn will latch onto our dna and they will be in full control of future genome. To do this they used our own biology against us as a weapon, and the fact they longed poisoned our immune system and created a scare known as covid 19 another manmade pandemic, well last one killed many then war ontop of that great depopulation kurb but great profit also for big pharma and military complex. They created this pandemic basically its a biological weapon they are cashing in on now to CHANGE and CONTROL mankind from within, so they use natural cold, our tainted immune system, 5g towers and frequency based technology in sync, even down to weather manipulation to affect immune system by fluctuating hot and cold over and over. You wonder why how odd we had multiple things in single day going on in our climate even over time how its shifting oddly and seasons out of whack. Perfect tool to make one or billions ill, create a cocktail to kill and lower life expectancy more so of old blood and another to taint new blood aka new genrations with the mark of the beast. Funny how youth are immune unless they are seriously ill in first place from a cancer etc. Human mind is gullable, do your fucking homework on scientific quotes, were programned daily, human conditioning a thing especially when your shown a pandemic film, series or game 2 to 3 month prior lol then use of Cognotive Dissonance on you. Everybody as this virus inside them its just been activated because science as been poisonibg our system for decades in food, water even air. Before i go, can anyone tell me what or who 'Baal' is ? I know but i love a reply because if you do science too or know of it and know the periodic table it also means two elements! Just a little bit of info for you, these elements are what you see pumped out of jets fuel as it burns out leaving trail BArium and ALuminium is then dispersed into atmosphere within a contrail but inturn becomes a chemtrail, this creates a film in air that reflects sun light back in essence making weather change, become colder,  affecting photosynthesis, effecting life too. What better way to get one ill by altering the climate. This also serves as another purpose dousing your body with heavy metal particulates inhaled, in fluids ie water and in food ooh and its been proven its the cause of alszeimers heavy metal on the brain creating memory loss as it blocks our natural receptors in our brain inturn dumb one down or becoming brain dead. Notice flight paths only mask certain skies zones but also notice on clear blue day its beautiful then soon as you see this shit it becomes colder and darker, wether changes in 24 hrs and last a day, days, week or weeks. Enter a sauna then dip yourself in cold bath and keep repeating that for 30 mins tell me your body wint become ill, in shock, feverish etc not forgetting all the edible and drinkable things contaminated. Were becoming a ticking time bomb but yet they tell you too wear a mask ????? Any bright spark especially a fucking doctor would say thier are 3 ways to catch a virus #1 Mosquitos(which are being bred and released, genetically modified in farms to now become seasonal bug not a summer bug.) #2 Vaccinations(mixed with all sorts even animal dna, down to chemicals even mercury at times.) #3 unclean sex (Aids/Hiv, a manmade virus created to kill off african population because they breed like rabbits even in a poor continent, why keep breeding if in poverty ? But a tool that worked and spread globally.) In essence penetration is only way to get a virus that reacts to your tainted blood that big pharma created. So why a mask viruse are not airborne, and also why starve your brain more of oxygen is it any wonder cant breath ontop breathing conditions in health and in society through pollutions. You dumb people seriously all of you are from poor class to rich from no education to full education. You literally do as you told, believe everything the system tells you and when a person like myself, jesus, guy fawkes, robin hood comes along were blasphemers or conspiracy theorist cast out of society, stoned and crucified in many ways. Maybe a cleansing is need and those of truth ill or healthy will prevail. Yet you glued to material things, read propaganda and still you have not learned people. Many i could teach you all a thing or two about life and truth im only 40 but i think this is just a taster while most of us now of truth cant be arsed, gonna sit back and watch this unfold. Mark my words if you sheep begin to cast out people in stores because you believe a deception, the system wants this to happen cause chaos and create the sollution to thier doing. A civil war will break globally, i know im ready. Already i been shunned once and trust me someone of truth and decency to mankind already flipped and dropped a man by breaking his nose while in his mask try stop me getting food but how ironic he took his mask off. This is the new social experiment on many levels to kill old and taint the new, pass down genetics tainted with synthetic dna half man half synthetic perfect really they cant build robots to control with mind of human so why not use human turn them part synthetic to better control, a method that will take time but hey they already succeeded in science were metal fibres through intoxication as tainted brain or growth strands, even morgellons in time this will work as way to control or even a killswitch internally. Anyway i ranted lil too much but a wake up call is needed but hang on what does it matter because your 'Cognitive Dissonance' will kick in while reading lol shameful society world full of materialism, memes, narcacism and much worse, older generations if your reading this i hope you rest in peace someday you deserve it, you lived a lie and dont deserve to deal with more cruelty.",Positive

"Politicians are the most envious people on the planet. Too ugly to be movie stars but still prostitutes like Hollywood nonetheless. They are meant to be our servants but they sell themselves to the highest bidder.

Reporters/anchors weren’t talented/good-looking enough to be actors so they became script readers. Same with politicians. Since time immemorial actors/singers have been on the level of prostitutes. They aren’t authorities on ethics, science, etc. Neither does running around with a ball make one an authority on anything. 

When was the last time you asked a prostitute for advice? 

Remember those Chinese videos of people dying in the streets from Covid? What happened to that? Ever personally see that where you live? All communist kabuki theater. Chinese are so envious of America; Hate us cuz they ain’t us. 

Pandemics naturally come and go—or else we’d still be dying from the Spanish flu. Only 25% of people were vaccinated for H1N1, yet it disappeared. 

You have a 2% chance of adverse vaccine reaction but a .1% chance of dying—even if sick—from covid. You’re taking 20 times the risk with the vaccine! They only speak of risks and percentages with the vaccine—not covid. 

Moderna is 44 times more deadly than all other vaccines we’ve ever seen before. More people died from these covid vaccines in less than a year than all the vaccines from the last ten years. 

Just wait a few months-years. We will find out from the test animals what the vaccines will do. 

It doesn’t matter how many cases there are. This is how you know this is pseudoscientific nonsense. Then again Pfizer and these big pharma companies are low-class thug murderers. 

You’re immune once you get it and 99.98% of people don’t even show symptoms so why only push experimental gene therapy (‘veccine’) when safe tested conventional treatments exist? People used to have chicken pox and measles parties to catch it and get immunity. Vaccines injected in the muscle don’t give immunity the way catching a virus or disease does. 

Pfizer set a record for the largest health care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind with $2.3 billion in 2009.

Pfizer | Company History, Products & Lawsuits, COVID-19 ...

CDC is a for-profit entity that has no place in American government as per the 9th and 10th amendment. They have the audacity to say everything is forbidden to you unless they say it’s ok, even though the 9-10th amendment says the exact opposite—namely people have the right to do as they please unless powers specifically mentioned there in say otherwise i.e. 9-10th amendments limit government. 

99.98% of people who get covid won’t even show symptoms but will be immune once they catch it, so why risk taking a dna experimental vaccine which has already harmed and killed thousands of people—highly unusual for any vaccine. Covid “vaccines” aren’t traditional vaccines at all. They are experimental gene therapy. In fact we don’t even know if it’s covid or the flu as they never properly technically isolated covid—and flu cases went to literal zero—at least that’s what they would have us believe.

They will recall millions of gallons of ice cream or food if a handful of people die yet these injections for a disease 99.98% never show symptoms for (which means you’re immune and don’t need a ‘vaccine’) have killed so many people already and they have complete immunity. Fauci got immunity for big pharma in 1986. 

In other words 99.98% of people could skip the experimental gene therapy shot and still have antibodies. 

They tested mRNA injections (they are gene therapy not real vaccines) on animals for SARS and other diseases—All the animals died. They did no animal Experiments with this one (as barbaric as animal testing is). you are the animal tests. They showed us a bunch of people dying in the streets in China literally to scare everyone into unconditional lockdowns. Did anyone see people dying in the streets from covid?

There are many safer alternative treatments to vaccines. They are being artificially pushed on the public. It takes decades to test these properly, especially new technology. We have no idea what will happen in five years from now. Many rushed vaccines and medicines have had catastrophic effects such as birth defects and sterility. 

Not worth playing Russian roulette for the flu basically where 99.9% of people never even show symptoms. It’s not a traditional vaccine. It basically is appending the instructions of the dna with outside instructions, coding mRNA to manufacture proteins and injecting that into cells for ribosomes to manufacture. The problem is human biochemistry is incredibly complex and there are tens of thousands of proteins that can easily be thrown off balance; primarily either destructive self-reinforcing feedback loops that either diminish necessary protein synthesis or cause runaway excessive protein synthesis.

MRNA vaccines may be suitable to terminally ill patients, say with a cancer mortality rate of 80%, where the benefits outweigh the risks, but in healthy populations you likely may create more severe reactions and even deaths than would outweigh the benefits. They have many benefits to traditional vaccines but it takes sometimes a decade or more to test and develop these and the benefits are not worth the risks of an untested vaccine, including autoimmune disorders, blood clotting (stroke or serious cardiovascular events), and inflammation (leading to neurological damage, organ failure or cancer, etc) to name a few. We already have many studies showing covid vaccines causing adverse reactions not to mention all the botched rushed mass-vaccination programs like HPV.

The presence of unintended RNA fragments causing Immune response interference aka translated into unintended proteins, can include molecular deficiencies that can result in hormonal/endocrine disorders, infertility, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and many more. Plus we need to consider what happens if the protein folding part of protein production goes wrong, or only snippets of mRNA are produced that represent actual essential proteins and enzymes in the body but trigger an auto-immune response. Your immune system won’t differentiate Newton the necessary proteins and foreign pathogens and will begin to attack the body’s own essential cells or molecules (autoimmune disorder). 

vaccine manufacturers or FDA regulators can’t foresee theoretical side effects of an mRNA vaccine until months or years after the initial injection. These adverse events are likely to be systemic, not acute, and would not become apparent in short-term clinical trials. It takes decades to truly know what will happen and mRNA therapies have a lot of promise, but they are a completely new technology and i would never risk it unless I was a terminally ill cancer patient (for which there are other alternatives, especially starving cancer thorough certain diets including raw fruits and veggies and strengthening the immune system 

In the words of Cambridge’s phg Foundation:

There is still a lot of work to be done before mRNA vaccines can become standard treatments, in the meantime, we need a better understanding of their potential side effects, and more evidence of their long term efficacy.

https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines

The possibility that mRNA fragments might enter the cell nucleus and alter the genome of the host through some unknown process is possible, despite the assurances of scientists. History is littered with such scientific proclamations that led to catastrophic effects. 

They tested mRNA injections (they are gene therapy not real vaccines) on animals for SARS and other diseases—All the animals died. They did no animal Experiments with this one (as barbaric as animal testing is). you are the animal tests. 

Larry King was set to be clear and free with a clean bill of health out of the hospital but they gave him the mRNA injection first and he does like so many nursing homes! Don’t be naive 

Emergency room visits in the USA actually have flattened and has gone down since March, contrary to what they would have us believe in the news.

SCAM ANG COVID...
Totoo ba ito? 😭😭😭
Yung covid ay parang flu lang talaga yun bini brainwash tayo ng mga globalists na nakakatakot yun para macontrol nila ang buong mundo at iyan nga ang nangyayari ngayon. Ang motibo nila ay pabagsakin ang economiya. Then impose the NEW WORLD ORDER---ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT, ONE WORLD RELIGION, ONE WORLD CURRENCY.

They have began with the ""NEW NORMAL"" which is ABNORMAL.

Sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang buwan ay naganap ang gusto nilang mangyari:

Lockdown, ECQ-GCQ-ECQ-GCQ, social distancing, wearing of masks, etc.

Dahil hinihintay daw, within 18 months, ilalabas nila yung vaccine na lahat ay irerequire na magpaturok. Yung vaccine na yun ay quantum dots.

BAKIT 18 MONTHS? Kasi 18=6+6+6 or 666, the MARK of the BEAST. Lahat ng matuturukan ay bibigyan ng ID na ang tawag ay ID2020 at isa pa, eventually, lalagyan ng microchips ang mga mababakunahan which can contain info of the person and will also be used for all transactions na gagawin niya. Yung SOCIAL DISTANCING, sinasanay na ang tao para mas madaling mamonitor pag layu-layo through 5G technology. I might be wrong, pero ano pa ang maiisip natin?

YUNG MASK, kunwari for our protection pero in reality, it will suffocate the lungs. Just imagine hindi ka makalanghap ng sariwang hangin. It makes us more susceptible to viruses. The globalists are really killing the people slowly.

YUNG SOCIAL DISTANCING, pababagsakin ng todo ang ekonomiya dahil hindi makapag-full force work ang mga tao. 

YUNG SOBRANG LOCKDOWN ay pababagsakin din ang health natin, as explained by the doctors in the video.

YUNG MGA GLOBALISTS ay kasama sila BILL GATES, ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION, BIG PHARMA, DR. FAUCI, WHO, mga bayarang scientists, at yung iba pang super yaman sa mundo. Kasama rin si POPE, at ang CHINA--the sleeping giant who is now slowly rising--the Dragon in the Bible. Malapit na ang tribulation period kung mananagumpay ang plano ng mga ito. Lahat ay nakalatag na. That is, if we allow these globalists to push through with their agenda, and if Jesus Christ will hastens His coming again.

Sa ating mananampalataya, walang problema dahil kung malapit na ang tribulation, mas malapit na ang Pagparito ng Pang.Jesus. Kaya tama ang ginagawa nating soul winning through celfone.

Pero kailangan din nating ipaalam sa mga tao ang balak ng mga globalists na ito. We have human rights na inalis sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang buwan.

Sana nga matauhan na ang mga mayor pataas hanggang kay President Duterte gaya ng nangyari kay President Trump at yung nagsalita sa video sa Italy na nagsabing hindi naman talaga 25,000 ang namatay sa covid sa Italy gaya ng nakatala sa covid count at ibinalita sa media. Yan ang POWER ng MGA BAYARANG MEDIA. 

ACCORDING to PRESENT STUDIES about COVID PATIENTS, 99% of those WHO DIED ay MAY IBANG SAKIT. 

Yun namang NA-TEST na may COVID ay 88-90% sa kanila ay NAKAKA-RECOVER at 10-12% lang ang NAMAMATAY. Pag ikinumpara sa population ng buong mundo, napaka MINIMAL ng DEATH, 0.00 something lang in percentage. In other words, HINDI TALAGA sya PANDEMIC but PLAN DEMIC.

Saka bakit PURO COVID CASES na lang ang nirereport na CAUSE of DEATH. Kasi doctors are being pressured to include covid as the cause of death. MALAKI PALA ang INCENTIVE ng mga HOSPITALS pag COVID ang IKINAMATAY. PERA-PERA LANG TALAGA.

Sana makatulong ang mga may katungkulan sa pagsisiwalat ng katotohanan. Hwag nating pahintulututan na manatili tayong sunud-sunuran sa isang systema na ang Diablo ang nananagumpay. Iparating natin sa pamahalaan ang katotohanan habang may access pa tayo sa media. 

While it is true that we must obey government rules, we also have the responsibility to tell the people and government officials about the truth.

Let the people know the truth, may God bless us all.

Copy paste if you care
Godbless us all🙏🙏🙏

Bagong pasa po ito now lang, pls pass to inform lahat ng Filipino.


""Be aware huwag kayong maniwala dyan sa vaccine nayan. 


Automatic na magpa- positive ka sa covid pag tinest kahit walang sakit. Yan raw ang pinasa sa congress dito.


Malapit na nila ilabas ang vaccine ngayon na may microchip. Huwag kayong magpapa- vaccine pag lumabas nayan dyan sa Pinas, 


kasi ibang klaseng needles ang ginagamit tulad sa Europe na my microchip. 


Ipakalat at ipaalam nyo sa lahat ng mga kaanak nyo... Hindi yan biro, 


itong virus ang way nila para ma implement ang microchip...
Yan ang makikita pag mag oopen ng website, ng US. 


Nakakatakot yan pag napasa na. ...
Pwede na silang basta pumasok sa loob ng bahay mo, pag nag mandatory nayan... Tiyak, magkakaroon ng war dito sa US. Dahil maraming against sa mandatory. 


Sa Canada, sapilitang pumupunta sa bahay para pilitin ang mga tao na ma test ng covid. Pag mangyari yan, lahat na bansa susunod na. 


May nag test na niyan dito gamit ang papaya fruit at nagka positive ang papaya sa covid. 


Ito ang sinasabi na bawasan ang bilyon bilyong tao sa mundo. 


Mga kampon sila ng Diablo, lahat ng testing kits galing sa US, kaya ang mga tao di na naniwala sa numbers of covid. 


Yung Dr. Fuchi na nagsabi na my vaccine na para sa covid, kasabwat siya ni Bill Gates. Si Bill Gates ang punot dulo ng lahat ng virus nayan. 


Pastor kasi siya sa Illuminati, isang devil church. 


Siya ang gumawa ng covid virus at dinala sa China 


at pag kumalat na sa buong mundo, siya na din ang maglalabas ng vaccine, panlaban sa virus. 


Plano na nila yan lahat dahil ito ang nakasulat sa revelation. 


Mostly, lahat na nga ng tao dito, may baril kaya pag mag mamandatory nayan dito sa US, war talaga ang mangyaryari. 


Yung mga doctors mismo ang nagsabi na di maganda ang vaccine sa katawan dahil puro chemicals ang ingredients at my biochip. 


May mga videos na dinidelete na sa youtube, 
para hindi na mapanood ng mga tao. 



Basahin nyo agad ito, bago nila burahin...
dahil lahat ng information about sa gamot ng china virus, 
o sa plano ng 
""WHO"" AT ""DOH"" ,AT NG MGA GOBYERNO... PINABUBURA AGAD NLA.""

"many dont understand the implications of a test that has false 
positives. do you understand that you dont need to die of covid to be a 
covid death, you just need to have a positive PCR test and if you died 
of a car crash but had a pcr test that said you have covid guess what 
you died of covid :D really no joke thats how they mark covid deaths 
doesnt matter if you had 1 week to live, if at your death bed you tested
 false positive you died of covid.. people die everyday but if they get a
 test that has a cut off cycle of 40 what are the chances that you have 
covid and are contagious? well almost 0 with a cycle threshold of 40. 
can you answer this question"" why did fauci say a pcr test of 35 is 
pointless and is jsut dead nucleotides""? and it doesnt take that much 
looking around to find out the labs are using cycle thresholds well 
above 35 like 40 to 45. if you still have a functioning brain you can 
see how this doesnt add up, why the fk would they run tests at 40 to 45

"PATIENTS ARE DYING BECAUSE MOST DOCTORS DO NOT KNOW THIS INFORMATION.  IVERMECTIN SOLVES the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Mountains of evidence proving its efficacy is now available  It is a drug used since 1975 and is a Winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize                     3/28/21

IVERMECTIN is considered as a “repurposed drug” since it was only last Fall that the ALLIANCE discovered it to be a SAFER SOLUTION to the CORONAVIRUS.  It PREVENTS Illness,  LESSENS SUFFERING and HOSPITALIZATION DAYS,  AIDS CRITICAL PATIENTS and THOSE ON VENTILATORS.  

           Ivermectin is good for persons with Allergies,  the Elderly,  All Phases of Covid,  Covid Variants, Long Covid/Long Haulers and Those Refusing Vaccines.   IVERMECTIN reduces viral load and replication.  Studies have shown action against Yellow fever, Dengue, Zika and others. It enhances Interferon.

 

       Dr. Paul Marik formed the FRONTLINE COVID-19 CRITICAL CARE ALLIANCE (FLCCC).  This original 10-member international group of ICU critical care specialists and scientists of Medicine evaluated IVERMECTIN and found it to be AMAZINGLY efficacious in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 patients.  Their Website is FLCCC.net

 

YouTube video: “The FLCCC Alliance press conference from Houston TX” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3yxrJwJQs    12/4/20

 

       Taken from the FLCCC.net website: “In October 2020, the FLCCC Alliance developed a prophylactic and early outpatient combination treatment protocol for COVID-19 called I-Mask+. It’s centered around IVERMECTIN, a well-known, FDA-approved anti-parasite drug that has been used successfully for more than four decades to treat onchocerciasis “river blindness” and other parasitic diseases. It is one of the safest drugs known. It is on the WHO’s list of essential medicines, has been given 3.7 billion times around the globe, and won the Nobel prize for its global and historic impacts in eradicating endemic parasitic infections in many parts of the world. Our medical discovery of a rapidly growing published medical evidence base demonstrating its unique and highly potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and to suppress inflammation, prompted our team to use ivermectin for prevention and treatment in all stages of COVID-19. Visit regularly (FLCCC.net) for updates—The dosing in the protocol may be updated as further scientific studies emerge.”

       “Dr. Pierre Kory, Ivermectin and COVID https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeYoXGoh96w&t=17s 2/25/21

 

       IVERMECTIN has many curative properties, mainly: anti-parasitic, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory. Positive IVERMECTIN results can be seen quickly after administering the initial doses and it is an extremely safe and inexpensive drug. Contraindications list warfarin, however, those who have been on blood-thinning medications have had better results since the Covid-19 virus sometimes causes blood clots. Some people with allergies have been treated with Epi-pens or taken to the ICU after their injection of Covid-19 vaccines (see drugs.com for drug contraindications)

 

       The PROTOCOL that needs to get into the hands of ICU doctors, physician assistants, nurses and pharmacists is found at this website: https://covid19criticalcare.com/ or FLCCC.net It is called the I-MASK+ Protocol: https://covid19criticalcare.com/i-mask-prophylaxis-treatment-protocol/i-mask-protocol-translations/

The cost of treating 100 people with IVERMECTIN is about $3.00; the cost of

treating 100 people with the double-dose Pfizer vaccine is $4,000.

 

The World Health Organization stated on 2/15/21 that they will give its recommendations about Ivermectin in the coming weeks. 



The virus vaccines are being released with questionable safety records with emergency usage authority, whereas, the IVERMECTIN drug, which has a proven safety record for 45 years, needs much more TRIAL DATA to prove its SAFETY.  Vaccine companies cannot be sued for any injuries to people so they are dispensed quickly.  The US FDA, WHO and CDC have much to answer for in delaying their recommendations on IVERMECTIN during a PANDEMIC. They are not working fast in this CRISIS.  Also, some foreign countries look to the USA for medical direction; approval delays are extending suffering and costing the lives of millions with coronaviruses.",Positive

"Getting a cure for HIV is a powerful concept, often spoken of the HOLY GRAIL of HIV research. Although effective anti-HIV drugs have transformed HIV into a chronic manageable condition you live with rather than die from- taking life-long therapy is a very different proposition to being definitively cured.

"WOULD YOU LIKE THE ACTUAL TRUTH ABOUT THE COVID-19 VIRUS?  The following 2010 Document will explain everything:


The Covid-Plan / Rockefeller Lockstep 2010


They hypothesize a simulated global outbreak required steps, various phases, overall timelines, and expected outcomes. This was posited in the Rockefeller Lockstep 2010:



Create a very contagious but super low mortality rate virus to fit the needed plan. Using SARS, HIV, Hybrid Research Strain created at Fort Dietrich Class 4 lab from 2008 to 2013 as part of a research project to find out why corona viruses spread like wildfire in bats but have an extremely hard time infecting humans. To counteract that, they added 4 HIV inserts into the virus. The missing key to infect the human is the Ace-2-Receptor.



Create a weaponized version of the virus with a much higher mortality rate as a backup plan. Ready to be released in Phase 3, but only if needed. SARS, HIV, MERS, Weaponized Tribit Strain created at Fort Dietrich Class 4 lab in 2015.



Transport the Research Strain to different Class 4 lab, the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg Canada, and have it “stolen and smuggled out by China”, Xi Jang Lee, on purpose and taken to China’s only Class 4 lab which is Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan China. For added plausible deniability and to help cement the wanted backup public script as something to fall back on if needed. The primary script being its natural. Backup script being that China created it and released it by accident.



Fund all the talking heads: Fauci, Birx, Tedros and agencies, World Health Organization, NIAID, the CDC and also the UN, that would be involved with pandemic response prior to the planned release of the Research Strain to control the wanted script throughout the operation.




Create and fund the vaccination development and roll out plan so it’s capable of being rolled out on a global scale. Gates: A Decade of Vaccines and the Global Action Vaccine action plan, 2010 to 2020.


Create and fund the vaccination, verification and certification protocols, Digital ID, to enforce/confirm the vaccination program after the mandatory roll out is enacted. Gates: ID2020.



Simulate the lockstep hypothesis just prior to the planned Research Strain release using a real-world exercise as a final war game to determine expected response, timelines, and outcomes, Event 201 in Oct 2019.



Release the Research Strain at the Wuhan Institute of Virology itself and then blame its release on a natural scapegoat as the wanted primary script. Wuhan wet market, Nov 2019. Exactly the same as the simulation.



Downplay the human-to-human transmission for as long as possible to allow the Research Strain to spread on a global scale before any country can lock down respond to avoid initial infection.



Once a country has seen infection in place, lock down incoming/outgoing travel. Keep the transmission within the country spreading for as long as possible.



Once enough people in a country/ region are infected, enact forced quarantines/isolation for that area and expand the lockdown regions slowly over time.



Overhype the mortality rate by tying the Research Strain to deaths that have little to nothing to do with the actual virus to keep the fear and compliance at a maximum. If anyone dies for 
any reason and is found to have Covid, consider it a Covid death. And if anyone is thought to of maybe had symptoms of Covid, assume they have Covid, and consider it as a Covid death.


Keep the public quarantines for as long as possible to destroy the region’s economy, create civil unrest, break down the supply chain, and cause the start of mass food shortages. As well as cause people’s immune system to weaken due to a lack of interaction with other people’s bacteria, the outside world, aka the things that keep our immune systems alert and active.

Downplay and attack any potential treatments and continue to echo that the only cure that is viable to fight this virus is the vaccine.



Continue to drag out the quarantine over and over again in “two-week intervals” [There is that two weeks spell casting again. It is a CIA program.] causing more and more people to eventually stand up and protest. Defy them.



[And here is the key part to now:] Eventually end Phase 1 quarantine once they get enough public push back, expected June 2020, and publicly state that they think it’s “too early to end the isolation, but I’m going to do it anyways.”



Once the public go back to normal, wait a few weeks and continue to overhype the Research Strain mortality rate, Aug to Sept 2020, and combine it with the increase in deaths due to people dying from standard illnesses at a higher rate than normal due to having highly weakened immune systems from months of being in isolation [Which backs up what I said: you should social-distance people who wear masks regular. That’s what they’ve just told you. They have highly weakened immune systems.] to help further pad the mortality rate and also hype the up and coming Phase 2 lockdown.




Eventually, enact Phase 2 quarantines, Oct through Nov 2020, on an even more extreme level and blame the protesters, mostly people who don’t trust their governments already, as the cause of the largest second wave whereby the media will say ‘we told you so. It was too early. It’s all your own fault because you needed a haircut. Your freedoms have consequences.’ [Should this all unfold in this manner, the US election will be cancelled delayed or suspended. My opinion. How can you vote with Phase 2 quarantines? You can’t.]

Enforce the Phase 2 quarantines at a much more extreme level increasing the penalty for defiance. Replace fines with jail time. Deem all travel as non-essential. Increase checkpoints, including military assistance. Increase tracking/tracing after population via mandatory app. Take over control of food, gas, and create large scale shortages so that people can only get access to essential products or services if they are first given permission.



Keep the Phase 2 lockdown in place for a much longer period of time than the Phase 1 lockdown, continuing to destroy the global economy. Further degrade the supply chain and further amplify the food shortages and the like. Quell any public outrage using extreme actions or force and make anyone who defies them appear as public enemy #1 to those who are willing to submit.



After a rather long Phase 2 lockdown of 6 months plus, roll out the vaccination program and the vaccine certification and make it mandatory for everyone, giving priority access to those that submitted from the start and have those that are for it attack those that are against it, saying ‘they are a threat and the cause of all the problems’ by using words like “We can’t go back to normal until everyone takes the vaccine.” And people defying them are “hurting our way of life and therefore are the enemy.” [In other words they are going to turn the people against each other.]




If the majority of people go along with the agenda, then let those people enter the new system, the new normal, while limiting the minority that defied the agenda’s ability to work, travel and live.


If the majority of people go against the agenda, then release the Weaponized SARS/HIV/MERS Tribit Strain as a Phase 3 operation. A virus with a 30+% mortality rate as a final scare to punish the minority to quickly become the majority and give a final “We told you so” to those that didn’t listen.



Enact the new economy model. Microsoft patent 060606 crypto currency system using body activity data which is based on human behavior and willingness to submit. It is a tweaked version of the black mirrors 15 million merits program using food, water, shelter, and other essentials as a weapon of enforcement of the new economic system. Basically, do what we want and get rewarded. Gain credits score and gain more access to things you need to survive. Or go against what we want and get penalized. Lose credits score and lose access to things you need to survive.





Footnote:



And that is your New World Order: technology on steroids where you have no option but to comply. And if anyone thinks that this isn’t true, then go and check out some parts of China because they’ve already started some of the crypto currencies system in place in certain areas.

So, this is the outline of their plan. And what we have to stop by outing it in as many places as possible. And also calling out Q and Trump and asking them: Are you going to stop this? Mass arrests are irrelevant. This is essential and this has to be blocked.

"""Frank Shallenberger, MD. HMD, has been practicing medicine since 1973 and has been a Pioneer in Integrative Medicine since 1978.

""Dear Patients and Friends.
Last week I must have been asked 20 times about the new COVID vaccines. Here are my thoughts. Please pass this information onto many as you can. People need to have fully informed consent when it comes to injecting foreign genetic material into their bodies.

1. The COVID vaccines are mRNA vaccines and don’t really fit into the definition of vaccine, but for ease of reference I will refer to it as such. mRNA vaccines are a completely new type of vaccine. No mRNA vaccine has ever been licensed for human use before. In essence, we have absolutely no idea what to expect from this vaccine. We have no idea if it will be effective or safe.

2. Traditional vaccine simply introduce pieces of a virus to stimulate an immune reaction. The new mRNA vaccine is completely different. It actually injects (transfects) molecules of synthetic genetic material from non-humans sources into our cells. Once in the cells, the genetic material interacts with our transfer RNA (tRNA) to make a foreign protein that supposedly teaches the body to destroy the virus being coded for. Note that these newly created proteins are not regulated by our own DNA, and are thus completely foreign to our cells. What they are fully capable of doing is unknown.

3. The mRNA molecule is vulnerable to destruction. So, in order to protect the fragile mRNA strands while they are being inserted into our DNA they are coated with PEGylated lipid nanoparticles. This coating hides the mRNA from our immune system which ordinarily would kill any foreign material injected into the body. PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been used in several different drugs for years. Because of their effect on immune system balance, several studies have shown them to induce allergies and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been shown to trigger their own immune reactions, and to cause damage to the liver.

4. These new vaccines are additionally contaminated with aluminium, mercury, and possibly formaldehyde. The manufacturers have not yet disclosed what other toxins they contain.

5. Since viruses mutate frequently, the chance of any vaccine working for more than a year is unlikely. That is why the flu vaccine changes every year. Last year’s vaccine is no more valuable than last year’s newspaper.

6. Absolutely no long term safety studies will have been done to ensure that any of these vaccines don’t cause the cancer, seizures, heart disease, allergies, and autoimmune diseases seen with other vaccines. If you ever wanted to be guinea pig for Big Pharma, now is your golden opportunity.

7. Many experts question whether the mRNA technology is ready for prime time. In November 2020, Dr. Peter Jay Hotez said of the new mRNA vaccines, ""I worry about innovation at the expense of practicality because they [the mRNA vaccines] are weighted toward technology platforms that have never made it to licensure before."" Dr. Hotez is Professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, where he is also Director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.

8. Michal Linial, PhD is a Professor of Biochemistry. Because of her research and forecasts on COVID-19, Dr. Linial has been widely quoted in the media. She recently stated, ""I won't be taking it [the mRNA vaccine] immediately – probably not for at least the coming year. We have to wait and see whether it really works. We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know.""

9. In November 2020, The Washington Post reported on hesitancy among healthcare professionals in the United States to the mRNA vaccines, citing surveys which reported that: ""some did not want to be in the first round, so they could wait and see if there are potential side effects"", and that ""doctors and nurses want more data before championing vaccines to end the pandemic.""

10. Since the death rate from COVID resumed to the normal flu death rate way back in early September, the pandemic has been over since then. Therefore, at this point in time no vaccine is needed. The current scare tactics regarding ""escalating cases"" is based on a PCR test that because it exceeds 34 amplifications has a 100% false positive rate unless it is performed between the 3rd and 5th day after the first day of symptoms. It is there for 100% inaccurate in people with no symptoms. This is well established in the scientific literature.

11. The other reason you don’t need a vaccine for COVID-19 is that substantial herd immunity has already taken place in the United States. This is the primary reason for the end of the pandemic.

12. Unfortunately, you cannot completely trust what you hear from the media. They have consistently got it wrong for the past year. Since they are all supported by Big Pharma and the other entities selling the COVID vaccines, they are not going to be fully forthcoming when it comes to mRNA vaccines. Every statement I have made here is fully backed by published scientific references.

13. I would be very interested to see verification that Bill and Melinda Gates with their entire family including grandchildren, Joe Biden and President Trump and their entire families, and Anthony Fauci and his entire family all get the vaccine.

14. Anyone who after reading all this still wants to get injected with the mRNA vaccine, should at the very least have their blood checked for COVID-19 antibodies. There is no need for a vaccine in persons already naturally immunized.
Here's my bottom line: I would much rather get a COVID infection than get a COVID vaccine. That would be safer and more effective. I have had a number of COVID positive flu cases this year. Some were old and had health concerns. Every single one has done really well with natural therapies including ozone therapy and IV vitamin C. Just because modern medicine has no effective treatment for viral infections, doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.

"Mana sampelvirus-Covid19 kalian yang sudah melewati Proses-Pemurnian? Mana tulisan-ilmiah kalian tentang bagaimana proses-pemurnian itu dilakukan? Kok nggak-punya tapi berani pura-pura tauk tentang penyakit-Corona? Kapan kalian bikin penelitian dengan sampelvirus-Covid19 yang asli? Sampel tempe-bongkrek yang kalian pake kaleee.......
Wong boss/tuhan kalian saja (WHO) itu bahkan sudah ketanggor bohong dan ketanggor SENGAJA PALSUKAN SAMPELVIRUS-COVID19 kok.
Corona itu bukan wabah/pandemic kok. Biasa saja. Corona ini infodemic alias penipuan-massal oleh IDI, mediapers-mainstream dan politikus/pejabat-kotor.

Duileee.... yang mau jadi wakil-Zionis(Illuminati) buat perbudakan-NWO dan memperbudak rakyat-Indonesia segitu-banget sich: ""Maju-sebarhoaxtipuan terus pantang-mundur"". Padahal kalo gua liatin itu muka-kalian udah keliatan kayak pantat loch itu sangking kalian nggak-taukmalu nya.

Kalo sampelvirus juga kalian nggak-punya, berarti alat-test kalian juga SEMUANYA SENGAJA KALIAN BIKIN NGACO khan..... Biar terkesan SEOLAH KORBAN-COVID19 itu banyak padahal sakit-panu pun kalau perlu dijadikan korban-Covid19 juga. Pokok nya: ""APAPUN PENYAKIT NYA, JADIKAN MEREKA KORBAN-COVID19"". Gitu khan...

Kalo meninggal misalnya karena penyakit-jantung, mbokya jujur dibilang ""MENINGGAL KARENA JANTUNG (bukan karena Covid19). Lach kok dijadikan korban-Covid19 gitu sich...
Mbokya ngomong saja terus-terang kalo itu pasien sebenarnya meninggal karena Komorbid (bukan karena Corona/Covid19).

Lagian kalo nggak-punya sampelvirus-murni, boro-boro bisa bikin vaksin....wong bikin penelitian tentang Corona saja nggak-bisa kok.
Selama ini yang kalian bicarakan tentang Covid19 dan korban-terinfeksi nya jelas-jelas cuman karangan-belaka doank kok.

Vaksin-Covid19 itu isi nya adalah: ""Virus-Covid19 yang sudah dilemahkan khan"", padahal kalian nggak-punya sampelvirus-Covid19 yang sudah melewati proses-pemurnian gitu kok.
Trus vaksin kalian itu isi nya apa yach? Cendol-Dawet kah? Hueheheheh...

Coba kalian contek caranya Ibu Siti-Fadilah selesaikan/tangani vlrus-fluburung dahulu-kala itu dech. Pasti Indonesia bebas-Corona:
1.Nggak-ada lagi rakyat-kecil bangkrut dan kelaparan lagi;
2. Nggak-ada ibu-ibu keguguran;
3. Nggak-ada orang yang meninggal karena ditakut-takutin Corona (Skizofrenia);
4. Nggak-ada lagi rakyat yang diperas musti bayar denda-ini dan denda-itu;
5. Nggak-ada rakyat disuruh sedot gas CO2 nya sendiri gara-gara musti pake masker segala;
6. Sekolahan lancar dan bisa tatap-muka, generasi-muda nggak-jadi bodoh seperti sekarang;
7. Busway, masjid, dll bisa muat-penuh lagi dan segala-macam unefficiency+uneffectiveness bisa dihindari;
8. dan masih banyak-banget kerugian lainnya bisa dihindari.

Kami rakyat-Indonesia menolak New-Normal, kami rakyat-Indonesia cuman mau yang Normal-Normal saja...!!!
Kami rakyat-Indonesia juga adakan transaksi-alternatif dengan dinar+dirham sebagai jalankeluar-mandiri(bertahanhidup dan penjuangkan masadepan anak-anak kita) dari krisis-ekonomi buatan pemerintah-ZionisIndonesia atas perintah Zionis/Illuminati/penyembahsetan dengan sandiwara-Corona nya ini. Bertransaksi dengan dinar+dirham itu hak-asasi kita sebagai manusia. Kalau mereka melarang dan penjarakan kita cuman gara-gara kita juga bertransaksi dengan dinar+dirham(selain juga dengan Rupiah), berarti mereka lach yang radikal/teroris/intolerant. Kalau mereka melarang dan penjarakan kita cuman gara-gara kita juga bertransaksi dengan dinar+dirham(selain juga dengan Rupiah), berarti harus kita lawan. Mereka yang melarang kita pakai dinar+dirham adalah antek-Illuminati(Zionis) penyembah-setan. KITA LAWAN MEREKA...!!!
Kita (rakyat-Indonesia) juga bangun-sendiri perekonomian(+industri+tani+ternak) secara kerakyatan (bottom-up: Sedari Bawah menunu Atas).

NKRI dan Pancasila kita memang sedang dirampokin Zionis/Illuminati/Neokolim dan sandiwara-Corona ini adalah alat untuk menjerumuskan rakyat-Indonesia ke dalam jurang-perbudakan/perampokan oleh NWO (New-World-Order / Novus-Ordo-Seclorum). Tambang sudah semuanya di-sita Zionis(Illuminati) dan beberapa-pulau juga sudah mulai disita gitu kok (Pulau Komodo, dll).
.........
Jadi uang-rakyat Rp.90Milyar itu dipake bukan untuk melindungi rakyat-Indonesia melainkan justru untuk membiayai kegiatan penipuan/perbudakan terhadap rakyat-Indonesia. Jadi 90M itu justru untuk membiayai misi menjerumuskan rakyat-Indonesia ke dalam jurang-perbudakanNWO seperti ini toooo....
Padahal duit segede itu didapatkan dengan cara ""Berhutang kepada World-Bank(YahudiZionis/Illuminati)"" dan harus dibayar oleh rakyat-Indonesia dalam bentuk pajak. Jadi rakyat-Indonesia dibikin: ""Membiayai kegiatan untuk membahayakan/menyusahkan rakyat-Indonesia sendiri"".
.........
Kita perjuangkan menghukummati IDI dan mediapers-mainstream (KompasTV, MetroTV, CNBC, CNN dll) atas kejahatan sandiwara-Corona ini.

"Eating the KUMQUAT fruits ""raw"" (with the skin off course) can help healing COVID, cold flu, cough, sore throat, itchy throat, runny nose... fast. Note, medication (that is medicine) is still be taken regularly if required. The Kumquat fruits shall make sickness last 3 days, instead of 7-10 days after taking medication.

When you feel you are having the very first sight of cough, sore thoat, itchy throat, runny nose ... then chew the whole kumquat fruits and swallow them one by one (off course you must spit out the seeds). Try to eat 3-5 of them. This shall prevent sickness getting worse.

https://www.greenbarnnursery.ca/products/murami

When I have symptom. I have to take ADVIL medication and eat these fruits. Very helpful. 

https://www.advil.com/our-products/advil-tablets/

Note: you must have this ""kumquat plant"" at home. It is not expensive ($20-$60). It does not need much care, except watering daily. And yet it give fruits ""all round year"", even in winter.

"Research high dose Vitamin D3, zinc, querectin and Vitamin C to help boost your immune system  and help your body fight any virus. Zinc prevents the lost of taste and smell and stops the replication of the virus.

 If you can't get quercetin(opens cells up so zinc can enter) and zinc right now then look into tonic water with quinine( I mixed with green tea cause tonic water has a lot of sugar) and high zinc foods. Cut the sugar and carbs. Look up anti inflammatory diet. Bone broth, ginger, broccoli and lean protein. Probiatics or fermemted foods. Pink Himalayan salt in water. Drink as much water as you can.

If you get a fever then let it run its course so yoir body can know tp fight the virus. If its over 103 then you can take a pain reliver. Hot baths, but careful of fainting. 

Sleep enough, but don't sleep all day. Stay active while you quarantine. Look into N.A.C vitamin too. Could prevent blood clots. Pray for no pneumonia.

 Go in your back yard for a light execercise with no mask to get oxygen and hopefully sun. Focus on breathing exercises. If your high risk then try to talk to a doctor about ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine/zinc or budesonide. Look up Dr. BERG covid, med cram What to do when you get covid.  Dr. Eric Nepute covid.

The sooner you help your bodg fight the less symtpoms and faster recovery.

"The CDC recommends you safeguard yourself and others by taking the following precautions: cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough; wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; If you’re sick, avoid contact with others so that you don’t spread the infection. More than 150,000 people die every day. The leading cause of death isn’t a virus. It isn’t old age. It is sin. The Bible says, “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 6:23). Sin is the violation of God’s law. God has written His law on your heart. Being created in the image of God, you know it is wrong to lie, steal, take God's name in vain, or hate another human being. Because God is good, He must punish sin. The punishment He has determined for sin is eternity in Hell. God has provided only one way for you to escape His wrath and receive His forgiveness. Your only hope is for Jesus to save you from the wrath of God. God the Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He voluntarily shed his innocent blood and died on the cross, taking upon Himself the punishment sinners who would believe in Him rightly deserve for their sins against God. Three days later, He defeated sin and death when He rose from the grave. Repent and believe the gospel while God has given you time.",Positive

With flu I get symptoms in a particular order (idk if it’s just me but it follows an order of symptoms as what I have observed for getting flu every year) first I get a sore throat that is so painful it wakes me up in the middle of the night usually after midnight yes around that time, it’s weird i know, then in the morning to afternoon I’d have runny nose and clogged nose at the same time also cough with lots phlegm and that’s when I know that I’m getting the annual flu. I believe that’s how my body copes up with the changing weather (I live in the Philippines, so my body gets a hard time coping with cold weather) and then during the afternoon to night my body temperature gets high. In the following days I’d still have clogged and runny nose and cough, sore throat is gone and my body temperature would get better. It usually lasts for 7-14 days because I don’t like taking flu meds so I would only drink lots of water until it’s gone. 

Three days ago when I first experience sore throat that woke me up around 2-3am and it was painful, every time I drink water it hurts. The following days to now I have runny nose and clogged nose and persistent cough with less phlegm. I’m here because I’m having anxiety.

"Currently recovering from covid 19. I feel a lot better than I did a couple days ago. Pro-tip is stay HYDRATED and whatever you do, do not remain in bed all day. No matter how weak or tired your body may feel, you have to be somewhat active. The virus can fill your lungs with fluid. Get up every few hours and go for a walk either in the neighborhood or in the house. Also do not sleep on your back, either sleep on your side or stomach to prevent fluid from filling lungs. Make sure your head is elevated as if you sitting in an hospital bed. Get Vitamin C, D, and E in your system. Get elderberry to improve immune system.  If you have breathing problems, recommend go to the hospital to receive prescription of Ventolin HFA. This Inhaler helps to relax muscles in lungs in order to breathe better.

  In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of God Muhammad and every believer, Nasir Muhammad, who asked about the Pfizer vaccine for the American and German company, and all the vaccines for human doctors for Corona virus, and every period of new recitation is very bad. God has more for all stubborn infidels and I remember and say God’s peace and mercy be upon you  And blessings of the questioners who want to follow the caller of truth from their Lord from different parts of the world, I think the fatwa is crystal clear in the liver of the sky regarding the Pfizer vaccine and all human vaccines, and we mentioned to you the fatwa in all the data that we wrote about God’s minimum torment of what they call (Corona virus  And what is Corona is just an epidemic) (but a torment from God) to follow the caller of God and his successor to the worlds His servant, Imam Al-Mahdi Nasir Muhammad Al-Yamani, since I know with certainty that it is a torment from God, the Lord of the worlds, I challenge them with the complete words of God to find for them a vaccine from the punishment of God for what they call a virus  Coronavirus and the new durations and more, they will not find for them anyone who reveals harm and no transfer from them except for the true supplication to flee to God from the punishment of God, so they call him alone without a partner, since it is a torment in the wisdom of the great Qur’an, so everyone  He calls upon his God besides God, so that He may reveal them in the worst and worst of the torment. If you are truthful, the Pfizer vaccine or the vaccine for every Muslim and infidel will not reveal it to them. Know with certainty that the torment of God in the book, whether the lower or the greater, is not revealed by the causes, whatever they are, and in the end the reasons will be interrupted by you except supplication and supplication to God  He alone has no partner, my Lord and your Lord, and if you want to save Muslims and the worlds, then you must intensify the publication of the statement that we wrote in a statement on the date of Ramadan twenty-six for the year 1441 AH entitled:
  Corona virus and the chapter statement and what is joking
  Statement link: https://nasser-mohammad.com/singlepost.php?p=329951
  In that statement came a fatwa from the Most Merciful on the same day on that day in the true vision from the Lord of the worlds in a dream of fasting that the statement that I wrote today contains a cure for what is in the breasts, this means that there is a miracle of healing from the Lord of the worlds without a vaccine or medicine to perish from the perished  On the authority of him and Yahya from who lived on the authority of God, and what I did on my behalf, and we will look and see the truest Imam al-Mahdi, Nasir Muhammad al-Yamani, or was he from the liars, and God’s judgment opens between me and the criminals with truth. Every arrogant, mighty, stubborn is the best of the conquerors.  Whoever deceives God unless they are counted, for every share of torment is given to God’s guardians. There is no fear for them nor they will grieve. Peace be upon the messengers, praise be to God, Lord of the worlds

Questions! Is this some kind of manipulation? Why are they trying to promote a vaccine that is not even a year old? If it takes years to develop a vaccine. How come they haven't developed vaccines for more lethal viruses?
What kind of experiment are they trying to impose on humans? Frankly I don't like this! Something is wrong! If you wake up! ... All you can do is wake up others. 🤔🤔
It's about promoting the sheep follower to their puppet leader⚠️☠️⚠️

Corona Virus and Announcing The Miracle of Healing Without a Vaccine nor a Medicine

In the name of Allah, Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), the Most Merciful. From the servant of Allah and Him Caliph, Nasser Mohammed, to all people

O people, I am the Imam Al-Mahdi (the Guided Leader), Nasser Mohammed, not only am I the caliph of Allah over Yemen but also the caliph of Allah over the whole world. [I swear] By Allah, there is no difference in my eyes between a Yemeni and a Chinese person

O Leaders of mankind and decision makers among their people, along with everyone that has reached their rectitude among Arab and Non-Arab and among Muslims and Non-Muslims, listen to and reason the ruling that I will give you with the truth; which is the decisive word that is not to be taken for amusement

I swear by Allah, the One, the Overpowering, that I do not know of any vaccine for you or a cure for what is in the chests from the torment of Allah except that you [humbly] entreat with the following supplication without arrogance towards the caliph of Allah, Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed. And the words for removing the torment of what is within the chests are to humble yourselves to Allah and implore with supplication to Allah the following

""Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.”

And after the repentance let each one of them say
“O Allah I am Your servant, I ask you by virtue of the fact that there is no God but You, and by virtue of the fact of Your Mercy which you have decreed upon Yourself, and by the virtue of the fact of the greatness of Your Pleasure within, which is greater than the pleasure of your heaven, to cure me of the torment of Corona or to turn it away from me as I am a believer in the caller to the truth from You

O Allah, remove Your torment from us from whichever direction it comes from, so that we follow the path of the truth from You. And strengthen us to fulfil what we have promised you, O you who intervene between a man and his heart, as we only have Your mercy, You have decreed upon Yourself. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers. O Allah You have said in the clear Verses of Your book
And your Lord says, {Call upon Me; I will respond to you}
[Surah: 40 - Ghafir - Verse: 60]

So the Dua'a (supplication) and the repentance is from me, and the response is from You and You do not break Your promise. Exalted You are our Lord, your promise is
true and you are the Most Merciful

O Allah Give us the strength to fulfil what we have promised You to follow the global caller to Allah, the caliph of Allah on Earth the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. O Allah, make the raising of him a blessing upon us and not a misery upon us because of our turning away from the call to the truth of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni”.

"People will likely not believe me but i will put this out there, most are so brainwashed by the lying media.
   Its true ""a strong terrain""is the best, ""BeChamp was right i was wrong"" -Louis Pasteur .
   But if you need a cure ,this is the best medicine i have found.
    If you want more info or help getting this extremely effective cure i will do my best, and i don't want ANYTHING from anybody except thank you if i deserve it.   i have found a great cure for Covid-19 
   it is the natural version of Hydroxycloroquine(quinine) perhaps you know something about quinine.  it is tree bark extract.  
 the tropical cultures have used to for eons. it works.  
     The invading british army was having many deaths from malaria years ago, the locals brought them what the Brits called ""tonic water"" they mixed it with their Gin rations (and sometimes fruit juice) saving so many Churchill said ""that tonic water saved more men than ALL the doctors in the empire combined""  think about that.that is the history of this very popular cocktail to this day,tonic water contains quinine(did you know that) ??
      Now we have Trump, and frontline doctors(video being scrubbed) saying that Hydroxychloroquine is working  .!!! how much proof do people need ???? really if that isn't proof go back to your GD television set or government controlled radio station !.
    I am a plant guy. i have identified over 200 for different uses !.  
   The natural form is found in many trees' bark,the favorite is the cinchona tree bark, (fever tree,jesuit bark, )   the bark is dryed and ground into powder. it is very cheap and like most herbs very tame on the stomach.  you can buy it on the internet ,4 oz. 7 dollars.approx.(enough for 50 people) then i put it in capsules.   
   My wife had shingles recently, it works on that too(vit-D ,zinc included together),(shingles is a strong virus) she has gotten corona virus and it cleared in hours. it is fantastic.! 
     like many of the natural plants, it WORKS . it has NO side effects and is basically FREE.   what else can i say ??   what does it take for people to see what is right under their nose ??????????? it also goes by the herbal name in some places ""Tepung Kina""
  of course the government will try to stop me, many will hate me, why would that be ? why am i even sharing this ??
  i suppose people want to do what they can to make the world slightly better somehow. i don't do much.",Positive
Covid affects everyone differrently. Half of my family got it some got it twice and some only had fever amd sniffles others no symptoms. It really depends on your immune system. About 8 people in my family has had it and 2 of them got it twice. All of them did just fine.,Positive

"They keep referring to the population of people as a herd. They begin to train us with masks and social distancing and we go along with it because we care about our fellow human being. But there's a longer game that is being played. They want herd immunity. And that means that they will force that herd to take those vaccines. And people will be assigned a symbol or a card that signifies  that they have been vaccinated. This is the true mark of the beast. They do not see ""the herd"" as people with all the rights of freedom that is given to us all the rights of humanity. They see us as a herd of beasts to be trained and culled as the powers-that-be see fit to do. This is the new Dawning reality.
And of course we are the beasts in their mind. Some of us may not appreciate that approach or that agenda and armed conflict may break out amongst the citizenry against the enforced vaccination.

I do not see it going back to normal. I don't think we have that option anymore. The media is behind this vaccination hype. Big corporations are behind this vaccination agenda. The elite support it. Which means that they will finance it. Which means that they will do their best to make it come about. If the population Rises up in significant amount enough numbers then they will back down and wait for another opportunity for control and oppression.

"Thanks for this video. I hadn’t been sick in over 12 years. This year on feb 27th I started with a slight sore throat . Worked through it for 3 days. By day 5 had a cough and fever . By day 6 went to the dr . Was negative for flu, strep, everything. They sent me to the hospital to check my lungs out . They were okay for that time so I was sent home . Then by day 10 I had a horrible cough and was having coughing fits where I legitimately couldn’t breathe. I called the dr again and asked them to please help me . Still no covid tests yet ( they got them about 2 weeks after ) . They gave me antibiotics. I kept getting sicker. The antibiotics didn’t do anything . Day 13 was wondering if my fever would ever go away . Called the doctor again. They gave me steroids this time . It took 3 more days but I finally started feeling better . On day 15 I had a fever and cough so bad I hadn’t slept in days ( every time I tried to sleep my cough would keep me up) so I came home and I slept for over 16 hours . Day 16 I finally felt a little better. Still a fever of 100.6 and very weak but just felt a little better . I only had diarrhea one night throughout all of it . Day 17 my fever broke for good. By day 21 I was feeling like myself again. By day 16 everything shut down . To this day my doctor apologizes for not giving me a doctors note to miss work . I went to work all those days (took ibuprofen before my shift so I could make it through) . I feel bad because 5 of my coworkers ended up sick as well. I am sure we all had covid and what was worse is I was the one who most likely gave it to all of them .",Negative

"The reason your body gets a fever or increases in temp is because it inactivated virions pathogenic to humans. Take hot showers and baths as hot as tolerable and as often as possible. The best most effective method to sweat out toxins as well as inactivate pathogenic bacterium and virion is to spend as much time as possible in the sauna with it as warm as possibly tolerable. It will be uncomfortable, but better to sweat it out right away then go to the hospital where you will be isolated depending on the facility by doctors and nurses and hospital staff and put on a ventilator when there are less harmful options and it’s been proven they are setting them way too pressurized causing the lungs to be destroyed ultimately killing the person who most likely had no outside guidance to avoid this and demand this and report this etc. it’s very sad as I used to work as a professional chemist after university at a university research hospital at the time the number 6 top facility in the nation, so my heart breaks knowing no person should be treated that way under any condition.",Positive

"Pure scaremongering. Do not be fooled by this nonsense. 
For a start all 3 studies are from China, where lifestyles are completely different to the UK. Air pollution in some cities is a real problem. People were protesting about this in Wuhan, before the announcement of any pandemic.
In the UK and most European countries, for the vast bulk of people who get ill, their symptoms will be nothing like what is presented here. That's assuming they even develop any symptoms: a lot of people have been infected without knowing it.
COVID-19 is really very little different to an ordinary seasonal flu. In terms of mortality rates, the statistics confirm this.
By the way, isn't it strange how seasonal flu appears to have disappeared this year, now that everything has been re-branded COVID-19?

"Covid19 breakdown 
COV=certificate of vaccine
id= Identification
19 = letters in Alphabet A and I
A= artificial 
I = intelligence
If you take ,it will give you a certificate of vaccination which shows you comply . Through nanotechnology Artificial Intelligence to small for the human eye to see you will be identified, tracked and traced with modern technology . It is controlled , monitored and positioned inside the body as directed by programming.You can't buy or sell without it , work or engage in any public activities etc. Stricter measures and lock downs will be enforced.
If you can't work or be part off society etc without it what does that sound like?  
Well it's something found in GOD'S WORD and that something is the MARK OF THE BEAST!!!! Revelation 13:16-17  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
 So many people say no its NOT but what if theyre wrong?
What if it is? it'll be to late!
Some say doctors and our Gov wouldn't do that to us. Really? Thats why so many have died from lying doctors and governmental experiments !
 What does GOD say about trusting lying men? In Matthew the first thing JESUS said when asked about the signs of the end was ""let no man deceive you"".
Its here people wake up and turn to JESUS because the MARK is here!!!
Who are you going to stand for satan, yourself , the world or JESUS. Who you gonna trust men or GOD? IF IT IS THE MARK AND YOU TAKE IT YOU WILL GO TO HELL!!! The way to know for sure is to submit your life to JESUS CHRIST and pray pray pray because HE is the ONLY WAY.

""...This was never about stopping a pandemic. Even the lockdown advocates never advocated that. But somehow that has been forgotten and “15 days to flatten the curve” has turned into a never-ending carte blanche for the biosecurity state to implement any number of draconian policies on its population, any number of policies on the checklist of the would-be dictator. Not only locking people inside their own homes, but constant surveillance of the population through the contact tracing and tracking apps that are increasingly being implemented around the globe, and, inevitably, the proposals for mandating the experimental vaccines which agents of the state will forcibly inject into people against their will.

This is not acceptable.""

Hello from Texas. We have a virus that possesses every symptom in the book to sometimes no symptom at all. Coronavirus tests that can be tested on animals and fruit and come up positive. People dying in various ways being labeled coronavirus deaths. I knew as soon as all this began that around November and December of 2020 when flu season came back around the false coronavirus numbers would skyrocket and here I am seeing my own prediction. Awfully convenient when the known flu season comes around you can tell everyone with the flu they have coronavirus in order to spread fear and push your agenda. I hope I’m not the only one seeing this. They wanna control us and this is a test.,Negative

Late on at night, Feb 13 2017, I came across Doctor AGBOMIAN herbal medicine. I browsed about the authenticity of This Doctor, I got to see several Testimonies regarding his works from people he had helped with his medicine. i reached out to him and told him my problems, after we spoke he promised to help me out.

"I was cured of HIV with the use of natural herbs. I love herbs so much. Sometimes, injection and drugs are just a waste of time. I was cured 8months ago but i had to wait for some months and did so many tests during this period to confirm that i am truly cured. I suffered from HIV for 2years, but with the help of Dr osaze herbal medicines,i was cured within some few weeks of drinking the herbs he sent to me through courier delivery service. This same doctor also cured my Aunty from herpes. As soon as i heard she had herpes,i referred her to the doctor and she was cured after drinking his herbs.I have since then referred about 4 persons and they were all cured from their various illnesses. Have you tried herbs before?. You have spent so much money on drugs,injections, etc and yet you have no good result to show for it. Dr osaze is a herbalist doctor,i believe he can help you if you can follow his instructions and drink his natural herbs.

"Just now being discharged from quarantine facility. I had asymptomatic Covid. What i felt during first 2 days were mild fever, blocked nose like a common flu, mild sleeping disorder (hard to sleep) and on the 3rd day i gradually lose my smelling ability until 100%. I can't even smell strong smell such as perfume sprayed in front of my face, rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, onion, etc. Also i have diarrhea but no stomach pain. Oh, and also during these days, my immune system start to haywire. I got paresthesia (buzzing,tingling burning sensation under your skin) on my shoulder, arm, until fingers. 5th days i was tested positive two times (PCR test). 

Transferred to isolation facility (basically  hotel with restricted access, you cant go hotel facilites, pool, etc. Food - ricebox and snack delivered daily in front of your door, room was self cleaned) for 10 days
No particular medication just vitamin B complex, Zinc, eucalyptus oil, and a lot of fresh fruits.

"Its all pseudoscience. Either the virus is complete BS or its real but has little to no impact on us when we get it. Ive been close to two people that got it and ive been fine. Whose to say i didnt get it and recovered at home? Did yall do the math on the mortality rate? Did yall take the total number of cases and put that as the denominator and put the deaths as the numerator to find the percentage of people that actually die from the virus? Naw thats too much digging and research for yall. Yall would just ride with whatever mainstream media says. I worked for the CDC for 8 months during the pandemic. I just got two other work from home jobs this week. This shit is a joke. Look how all yall scared sheep wearing masks. And they making this stuff mandatory like wearing masks and taking vaccines.. That isnt scary to yall? That isnt a sign of the last days and mark of the beast? I feel this virus/vaccine is the mark of the beast amongst other things. Will you take the vaccine and receive the mark? Ill leave the country but you can imagine with this new world order one world government shit they got going that they gonna have all countries all over the world complying with the same safety precautions. One world government. Biden gonna ride this agenda out hard. Closing schools and making vaccines mandatory etc. Look at what they doing in new york. Im not a fan of trump or biden but do agree with some of trumps statements such as the coronavirus hoax stuff and biden pushing this coronavirus agenda to create fear and keep yall so scared to where youd do anything they say cuz you are too foolish to think for yourself. Youll go to the doctor for broken bone and theyll misdiagnose you just to help nbc and fox's reporting on case numbers. Its to further their agenda. There are videos with both patients and nurses saying they are misdiagnosing people with covid and even killing them from malpractice and still people still going to the hospital to be murdered for an agenda....thats what you call a sheep. Its people who get both postive and negative results from two different covid tests the same day. How does that work? Because their testing system is effedd up too. They dont even know what they looking for lol. My little brother cant even play sports this year in high school because they keep cancelling games and practice because someone got covid like wtf. They are trying to keep everyone scared, separated, poor, in need of government assistance, so we can all gravitate more to social media and technology like staying on our cell phones 24/7 becoming robots and slaves to technology and this will take away from the social norms we are used too. Imagine the next generation's way of life, cell phones will control our society if this keeps up. A baby will know how to download an Instagram app on their iphone before they even know what 1 plus 1 is. Playing outside will soon be an extinct thought. This is whats going on right now. They are trying to lessen human to human interaction to let technology be your source of entertainment and control when you are bored at home and depressed because you cant find a job due to covid. Some schools in georgia have students going to school everyday while others are virtually doing school. Imagine what this does to the parents who cant work from home like me. Imagine what this does to kids who want to do extracurricular activities. 2020 is the craziest year and biggest brainwashing of the world that ive ever seen in my life or ever came across in history.

Virus spread risk at holiday celebrations

Celebrating virtually or with members of your own household poses low risk for spread. In-person gatherings pose varying levels of risk. Event organizers and attendees should consider the risk of virus spread based on event size and use of mitigation strategies, as outlined in the Considerations for Events and Gatherings. There are several factors that contribute to the risk of getting infected or infecting others with the virus that causes COVID-19 at a holiday celebration. In combination, these factors will create various amounts of risk, so it is important to consider them individually and together:

治療が終わっても苦しみは終わらない…。新型コロナに感染し、回復した後も後遺症に悩まされ、日常を取り戻すことが難しい元患者たちが数多くいることがわかってきた。しかし「治療後」の後遺症の問題は、差別などをおそれ患者が声を上げにくく顕在化もしにくい。後遺症による治療はいつまで続くのか－、職場復帰できるまでの暮らしはどうしたらいいのか－、金銭的な不安や健康面の心配など、元患者たちを支援していくにはどうしたらいいのか考える。

"Covid19 breakdown 
COV=certificate of vaccine
id= Identification
19 = letters in Alphabet A and I
A= artificial 
I = intelligence
So covid19 stands for a vaccine that when you take it will give you a certificate of vaccination which shows you comply and do as told so you can be identified, tracked and traced all through computer technology. You can't buy or sell without it , work or engage in any public activities etc.

So everything is fine, all but a stuffy nose and warped smell. 
Basically, i can only very faintly smell things like peppermint essential oil, or strong perfumes. But its not JUST that. Lately the ONLY smell i smell is one i cant recognize. No air i breathe anymore seems fresh. Even outside in a breeze. Theres this subtle but bothersome smell in the air that smells... (Idk how to describe it) kinda... Musty? Like.... I guess the closest thing i can compare to is if you walked into a 100 year old room. 
It makes me gag sometimes. I want an answer to why i have this. Its purely being created by my sense of smell alone. I hate it. Please help... Has anyone experienced something similar?",Negative

"Eh, here's mine:

Day 1-3 felt fine, except a lingering dry cough.  Day 4-5 had me feeling very tired, with the feeling that the room was never warm enough.  Day 6 the feeling of vertigo hung around me...of course, I moved around very seldom.  And, my sense of smell went away for about a day.  I always retained my taste.   

So, by the time I felt extreme fatigue,  I moved a space heater in my spare room and cranked it up.  I did wrap three blankets around myself.  It was never real uncomfortable,  but I did sweat profusely.   And, the sweating felt more better than it had annoying.  I'm on day 8 now, and relatively fine.  I still sleep with a higher temperature set on the space heater, because heat therapy helps aid respiratory infections.  From time to time, I experience a nasal congestion, which goes away as soon as I move around.  

My Dr. commented that this virus is so much like the 27 other known presently monitored active flu strains, that many are not feeling the type of serious symptoms to what this video has shown.  But, since its novel, it's best to err on the side of caution.   The way I figure, it's going to make its way to us eventually.   Just hopefully,  your ability to take self-care is as easy as mine has been.",Positive

"Do not take that vaccine. If 50% of the public is under a hypnotic trance that don't work on the other 50% we need the keyword to wake the zombies under the trance up. The vaccine has a wicked agenda attached to it for this reason. The science says all viruses are dead UNTIL they mate with a human cell at that point the so called virus becomes alive they tell the public a vaccine is safe because it only contains the dead virus, but science says all viruses are dead in air or the shot until they mate with a human cell therefore no live viruses exist as living until they are in the body of a human. The science says we need to get the shot because once we do our bodies will build up immunity to the virus making it not spread to others but as people get the shot, infection rates rise at the same rate as those taking the shot causing the tracking numbers to increase. But if you aquire a virus airborne the same science says your body somehow can't build immunity in that fashion if contracted by air TOTAL BS. This is why Trump said he was pulling out of the WHO and ignored our CDC and fired Fauci since these people have sold their souls to their devil for fame, fortune and a wonderful life promised to those who do the bidding of the banking cartel who are the real rulers of the world. Your body is actually more effective at defeating an air borne virus than it is if you inject a billion times the concentrated variant direct into your blood stream. This means a few things; one is you never needed a vaccine to avoid getting sick because the vaccine is the most direct way to actually get sick giving those who take the shot mega higher odds of getting sick and dying and mega times more capable of spreading the dead air borne virus to those not infected. Every year the CDC and WHO tell the public a new virus aka flu is coming (are they fortune tellers able to see the future?) WHY? Because guys like Bill Gates are engineering viruses to force DNA changes they hope will expand their ability to control the minds thoughts and decisions of those who survive the shots they promote and manufacture after they create the virus and distribute it over the air in the skies via chem-trails nano particles dispersed into the air like AGENT-ORANGE was sprayed on US Troups in Vietnam. That was the test government (banks doing business as a government) needed before funds would be invested in the trillions of dollars (off the national debt clock and radar) for chem-trail air campaigns during that war (Vietnam) which paved the way for infecting the public and when it only worked to infect a few the ones which responded to the chem-trail spray got infected they (people who became infected from chem-trail treatments) rush to get a vaccine assuring thier sickness even if the pathogen engineered and employed were lethal. They tricked every parent as a result of the AGENT ORANGE experiment to give their (American Inhabitants) new borns shots that caused their children over decades to develop deadly diseases like MS, Cerebral Palsy, HPV, Cancers of the blood like lukiemia sicle cell and parkensens, autism asthma and various skin diseases and auto-immune diseases the fake government would use their fake science to blame on genetics. These people are liars cons,  swindlers and expert decievers who have thier boss masters (banking cartel) pay the media for dis-information campaigns which leverage plausible deniability in order to recruit the obiding public (debt slaves who help the bankers create credit money in the form of fake loans to expand their wealth and corporate slaves in United States Corporation Company who U.S. Citizens become unknowing employees to by their own admission when ever they declare or certify they are something legally they are not) to demonize the fully woke public successfully recruiting thier victims (democrat voters who are unknown slaves to that party) to help thier wicked cause. Those who do as they are told (democrats) fight those who know (republicans) what this establishment (banking cartel) is doing drip by drip to bring the obedient (democrat) sheep to thier own slaughter. The idea your body according to science can't build immunity from something contracted via the air as well as a shot but can if injected is just plain STUPID but an overlooked and simple observation which proves the real intent and purpose of a virus mixed with a fake HOAX plan-demic campaign all can get behind because of a few dollars (stimulus money) attached to motivate the masses is CRAZY. The Biden camp and Trump camp want everyone to get the shot before they can resume normal life is a big part of this rouse and con designed to get people to do what they say you must do before you can be bailed out from your crisis (not able to pay the bills). Wake up they (banking cartel) is conning everyone to their own deaths. The Bible calls this Mystery Babylon. The Great Harlot is tricking everyone into drinking her cup of iniquity. Don't fall for this BS Biden is going to be the worse evil ever brought on to America ever because he is going to be a yes man to everything the banking cartel are seeking to bring the world to the end game. Great Depression V 2.0 (Global Edition) all because the bankers product patents and copyrights expire after 90 years they don't want competition they want to maintain a monopoly on the creation of money as credit and control the money supply so they can effectively control all humans. I don't know the keyword to wake those of you who are under their trance so to those of you I can only say WAKE UP. The reason Bill Gates (a democrat) is pushing with the rest or most of Hollywood for all to wear masks a first steps to test compliance before mandating all get the shot else they can't work, receive bailout money from the problem (fake government created and which you can sue them for (economic damages known as compensatory damages since they are employees of a covert corporation pretending to be a legitimate government) is so all will know the consequence for failure for not taking the shot or any other shot to come is you will be demonized as a mask-hole or a virus spreader or some evil label they will create to employ the masses on their side to stigmatize the woke population into submission of getting all to consent and pay for their own lethal demise. This is a conspiracy fact not a theory. Fact checking is a means this wicked system invented as bait for the fish who they seek to catch in their net of death founded and verified by those who manage this deception for the aims of fulfilling the Great Agenda of World Depopulation which they justify using the goal to balance nature when in reality its only because the banking cartel knows they can't control over 8 billion minds without risking getting busted in their Great Scheme to murder every one of the direct agents they promised great things to but also all of those they were hired to lead to the pits of hell. Yes 500 million population is just enough to leave the world with blood decendants of only the banking cartel members and their families. All of the cartels agents (members of congress, all leaders of world government, CIA, FBI, Secret Service, NSA, all DOI agents, Homeland Security agents, all police, sherrifs, lawyers, attorneys, other enforcement agencies like armed forces all will perish and be double crossed once those agents complete their hired tasks). The things the congress and world governments and billionaires have been promised to participate in the Great Depopulation agenda all tie into Green Plans and Healthcare meant to wipe out all wealth and income. Democrats have been said to provide welfare to the ever expanding poor and lower class (bubble up economics) while republicans provide corporate welfare (trickle down economics) both being done for the last near century in the name of capitalism. The reason the democrats must push socialism is because the lower spending class majority can spend or buy what they rich sell creating a possible outcome of the rich becoming wiped out joining the ranks of the poor they helped keep down. Bubble up works to prevent this but the lie of how money is made literally created is kept from the public so as they can maintain their control of the money supply and all people who use it as well. The lie of the National Debt and where taxes go which Reagan explained in the Grace Commission Report. People need to stop serving the beast right now and stop voting for your own destruction you must know that consent in playing their voting game is very important to Satan.",Positive

Nobody will be able to buy food, gas, or anything without the microchip , they will abolish all money and everything will have to be purchased by micro chip , they will say its for our own safety and that will be the death of humanity if we let it get that far .

They said if it didn't clear within 10 days come back or if it got worse come back immediately. within 8 or 9 days. It gradually started to subside. By day 5 or 6 I was able to eat food again.

questionable DNA vaccine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFsgvDrWV5w&fbclid=IwAR0P5GmQEVDsDgG-8Hig9IUioLFWIWYp7XgHf12Gn2JdVU_cXGOj1EbHjQI

"Maybe a 2.6% CV19 death rate if you count people with other multi major pre- existing complications, seniors exposed by other confirmed CV patients placed in senior homes by Democrat Governors to infect Seniors on purpose (murder in the case of the Governor of New York and other Democrat Gov when Trump gave them the use of the big Medical ships (Mercy and Comfort) and the convention centers which lay empty). Don't forget to count pretty much anyone else that died from any cause being counted as a CV to bring the numbers up to scare the people including car accidents, home accidents, traveling accidents. Remember hospitals got incentatives --$35K-$65K per CV patient so being greedy hospital administrators wanting to making ends meet had an agenda. Also don't forget the media blowing all of it out of proportion and having staged incidents as propaganda. And masks do not stop a real virus...that is why they wear complete self contained Bio Suits with oxygen hoses in the 265 Bio labs....how silly all you masked bandits looked running about wearing your designer masks ! Also Trump told the country he had the cure 4-5 months ago (HCQ) but Media ignored that story and pumped up the scare tactics saying a 55 year old drug was unsafe (which was not true- it is also used for many things including for Rheumatoid arthritis which I have personally taken).  Seems Trump had CV19 and was out and cured in 4 days instead of 14. Seems like nothing more than a bad flu and is being used as a Media /Democrat. Deep State scare tactic which backfired and Trump used the CV19 virus to saved 2 million sexually adrenochrome abused children in 358 deep under ground tunnels (dumbs)..hence all the minor 3.0 - 3.7 earthquakes as those tunnels were blown up by our military.

"THERE IS NO PANDEMIC globally; The World Health Organization estimates the common flu kills 290.000 to 650,000 people each year. Until the Covid 19 virus kills more than 650,000 people; it is less deadly than the common flu virus. Corona viruses have been around for 60 years. There are 36 different strains of corona virus, 4 of them have been known to cause infection for a long time. Corona viruses cause between 20-40% of the flu that we see worldwide. Screening tests are not specific enough to differentiate between any of those 36 different strains of virus. It is highly likely that everyone in the world has had some exposure to a corona virus and has probably had some infection of a corona virus somewhere in their lifetime. What most people don't know is that any 'test' for a virus does not test for a specific virus: It tests for antibodies that show up in your immune system to fight a virus. If someone tests positive, what does that actually mean? It means that at some time in your life your body developed certain antibodies to fight certain viruses. So if you test positive, does that mean you have an active infection? Does that mean you had an infection in the past? Does that mean you have an active infection of one of the 36 strains that have been around for 60 years? If you test positive does it mean that you’re sick? Or does it mean that you’ve been exposed to one of these 36 strains of corona virus and that it doesn’t bother your immune system? If you test positive for antibodies that fight corona virus, which strain of corona virus do you have? The new recommendations from the American CDC (and in Canada also)… is if someone is in the hospital with a respiratory issue and they die… then even if you have not tested them… or you tested them and they were not positive…you’re supposed to write on the death certificate “Co-morbidity”. This is driving the numbers up to maintain the agenda of mass hysteria, mass panic and mass fear.. It keeps the panic churning. . It is estimated that 12,000-16,000 deaths annually since 2010 can be blamed on the common flu virus in America alone each year. At least 8,200 people have died this season from the common flu virus in America. NOT from .the corona virus. The reason for these low members is the common flu is now being misdiagnosed as the corona virus. Otherwise the common flu deaths would be about normal: 12,000-16,000 deaths, AND BE IGNORED. There are 3.91 millions deaths caused by respiratory illnesses every year globally. HOW MANY RESPIRATORY DEATHS HAVE BEEN USED TO CREATE THIS HOAX? Recent studies by medical experts have revealed that the rate of infections is much larger by order of many magnitudes. As a result of the increased number of infected people; the death rate for Covid 19 has changed from 1.3% to roughly about .01%... Dr. Fauci himself told the medical community that Covid 19 is a seasonal flu with a mortality rate of .01%... A .01% death rate IS NOT A PANDEMIC… IT Is A HOAX.. Fauci has MILLIONS INVESTED IN VACCINES. Globally, there are 17-18 million deaths each year. Of the 32 main causes of deaths the corona virus ranks at the bottom of the list. Each year there are 3 million newborns who die in the world of pneumonia and 50,000 adults in the United States for the same cause, WITHOUT ALARMS BEING ISSUED. In many cases, they are misdiagnosing the common flu and calling it Covid 19. Anyone who dies of a respiratory ailment is being marked down as dying from Covid 19 They are lying to you.

Second... the global economy has been slowing down for years and a major depression was about to happen anyways... Third: What the Chinese CCP govt did was purposefully spread the virus and wait until there was enough ''reason'' to institute martial law and crack down on its population in order to terrorize and intimidate them because they knew a major economic depression was going to hit China.... If the CCP had not spread the virus, the Chinese people would have blamed them for the depression... This way, the inevitable depression could be blamed on the virus, not on the govt.. What happened next is that all the other govts that knew of the economic slowdown, who knew that a major global depression was coming, latched on to the fake Chinese """"pandemic"""" scare and pushed this hoax globally: to avoid being blamed for the oncoming recession/depression. Why did they do this?

If the CCP had not spread the virus, the Chinese people would have blamed them for the depression... This way, the inevitable depression could be blamed on the virus, not on the govt.. What happened next is that all the other govts that knew of the economic slowdown, who knew that a major global depression was coming, latched on to the fake Chinese """"pandemic"""" scare and pushed this hoax globally: to avoid being blamed for the oncoming recession/depression. Why did they do this? Because spreading: MASS FEAR; MASS PANIC; MASS PARANOIA; MASS SURVEILLANCE: MASS OBEDIENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES; MASS HYSTERIA: MASS CONFORMITY MASS BRAINWASHING: Is always good for the ruling class…. MASS IMPOVERISHMENT of the electorate; Making billions of people TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR GOVTS…. While the .01% get richer from HUGE bailouts to the banks and corporations. The most draconian military enforced lockdown since March has been Peru and they have the highest mortality from Covid in the world. Can you say world totalitarian surveillance states? Can you say one-world governed by FEAR and HYSTERIA? Can you say GLOBAL BRAINWASHING? Billions of the world’s masses are being impoverished due to this hoax. Over 50.million people died of the 1920 pandemic: COMPARE THAT TO THIS FUCKING HOAX. MASS FEAR; MASS PARANOIA; MASS CONFORMITY; POLICE STATE MARTIAL LAW. While destroying your society, your lives and your livelihoods… WAKE UP YOU ARE BEING BRAINWASHED INTO ILLOGICAL FEAR.",Negative

"My little sister had a fever that kept getting worse then soon a lot of my family members started feeling sick too. Of course they had to get tested and I was worried since I was the only one not sick and my anxiety made it even worse. My whole family basically stayed quarantine from eachother and the very next week the results came back negative which I was glad. 

But since school is being open and all.... my older sister had to go to school to another town and she was finding work experience in a place her friend worked in. Her friend invited her over to her sister house and they ate there... 

few days after my sister friend's sister got tested for covid along with her husband and they had it since the day my sister went over to their house to eat. My sister been coughing lately and I was starting to get really worried, A lot of things been going through my head.. she should get tested just incase but my family told me not to overthink, she came home when we got the message that the others caught covid so basically she's been around us. 

I've been staying away from my family members cuz Im scared for my whole family and I. I honestly was happy when I knew we weren't going to go to school but online classes are soo bad and knowing one of your family member might have covid helps makes u understand this is no joke. 
Im praying for everyone and hope y'all are safe, remember plz wear ur mask, use the hand sanitizer and stay away from anything to do with gatherings. <3",Positive

"H2O2
- is an endogenous substance indispensable for the immune defense.
- is correctly dosed and thus has been proven to be free of side effects and highly effective.
- releases oxygen throughout the body, including in the blood. Covid-19 leads to a massive reduction of oxygen in the blood, this can be balanced with H2O2 infusion 0.03% and thus the healing process is significantly promoted.
- Oxygen is indispensable for all healing processes.

- H202 Infusion 0.03% has been proven to be successfully used during the last major pandemic, the Spanish flu.
- Studies prove the positive, healing effect of H2O2 in Covid-19 disease for gargling.
- Studies show that H2O2 kills corona viruses on surfaces.
- With the scientific book ""H2O2Das vergessene Heilmittel"" by Dr. habil. von Jochen Gartz, a comprehensive collection of all scientific studies on H2O2 has been available for years.
In spite of all this there has obviously not been a single study until now that examined the effectiveness of H2O2 infusion 0.03% in Covid-19!
Closures of traditional family businesses, increase in mental illness, unemployment, domestic violence and child poverty, social desocialization: the consequences of corona measures.
We have a choice: do we remain true to ourselves, believe in our dreams and tasks or do we close our eyes to the truth because it is too uncomfortable, too simple, too obvious and therefore not a new discovery? 
We have the choice!
We can be the one to rewrite the history of Corona into a success story: Cost-effective, free of side effects, environmentally friendly and available worldwide!
My choice is not to give up until H202 infusion 0.03% has been scientifically clarified with regard to Covid-19.
I have no profit from it, I do not earn anything from it. But the feeling of having done what had to be done and what I could do, with my possibilities, my knowledge and my insights, that is my motivation, that is my success.
This is what I stand for with my name.

"I support and also recommend @ DR.Scottwitcher21 @GMAIL Therapy and health services .

I’m  surprised to read a question like this.

Most of us have been so strongly influenced by the medicine system that we have forgotten that mother nature has created the human body with the inbuilt capabilities to fight & cure most of the diseases naturally.

A person will not get a disease if all his organs & tissues work normally & the passage of solid, liquid & wind matter goes on smoothly through his body.

And in the event of any blockages or disturbances of these passages a proper exercise would release the block. A more specific way of releasing these blockages or activating the week organs is acupressure.
Generally to cure them you have to know what triggers them.??

So, Yes ulcers & many other chronic diseases/ ailments can be completely cured by this wonder therapy called acupressure . For a complete online cure pls contact::::::Dr.Scottwitcher21 @gmail.com.Or text  +1 339 201 9132 ..",Positive

"When the coronovirus enters the body, the rate of oxidation in the body increases and the level of hydrogen peroxide in the body increases. As a result, the virus produces stokin cells, these stokines attack lung albiol cells (respiratory cells), causing inflammation in the lungs. As a result, they prevent oxygen from reaching the cells and cause multiple organ failure, causing the patient to suffocate. If hydrogen enters the patient with corona from the outside, the oxidation process in the body stops, the hydrogen peroxide caused by the virus combines with the hydrogen coming from the outside to form water. Inflammation in the lung stops. In this process, the body gains time, during this time, the body's immune system can regroup and strengthen and destroy the viruses and the patient is healed. When hydrogen is used in the early stage, the symptoms caused by the corona disappear quickly and the disease can be overcome completely in a very short time. Details are on our site. Recover easily and quickly with our hydrogen breathing machines. www.cyberenerji.com",Positive
"Here’s the data, this is from the CDC itself, if you are infected with the Coronavirus and you are between the ages of zero and 19, your safety recovery rate, do you know what it is? 99.997%. Everybody between the ages of zero and 19, if you have kids like I do who were young, they are all under drastically more danger from the seasonal flu than they are from the Coronavirus. If you are between the ages of 20 and 49 your Coronavirus recovery rate is 99.98%. If you are between the ages of 50 and 69 your Coronavirus recovery rate is 99.5%.
“Think about that for a minute. Everybody under the age of 69 and below, which is the vast vast majority of the population in the United States, has a 99.5% or better recovery rate, if they actually get the coronavirus. And even if you are over 70 and you get it, you still have a 94.6% recovery rate.",Positive

I advise you to buy in farmacie the hydro-alcoholic extract of artemisia annua (the plant that Africans use against covid), you will take away from meals, 30 drops each time 3 times a day,

Buy an antibiotic called propolis in tablets. you take 3 compress in the morning and 3 in the evening.
Buy the effercent vitamins C mix with zinc take one effersecent in the morning and 1 in the evening. you don't need a prescription for these pharmacy products since I used them for a month to speed up my healing.

"QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS??? 🤔

1) Cases are going up.... But its not from the People who are NOT wearing masks - Because They aren’t the ones getting tested! 

Its from the People who ARE wearing masks....They are the ones getting tested and testing POSTIVE.... 

If social distancing and masks work - Why the Rise in Cases???

2)Why are the elderly catching covid when no one is allowed to visit them and staff are all wearing a PPE??? 

3) If social distancing and face masks work to stop the spread of COVID-19, Why are they so desperate to vaccinate everyone against the flu???

4) If Covid-19 is Spread by a single droplet of saliva and therefore a mask is necessary, Why do they have to stick a swab up your nose, to the back of your head to collect a Sample??? 

5) If Covid is so deadly why hasn't it affected the homeless??? - They Live outside, They don't social distance, and rarely wash their hands.

6) If Masks don't affect your breathing... 
- Why are people with breathing difficulties and respiratory illnesses Exempt from wearing them???

7) Serious Question - Where are all the biohazard bins, for all the masks and gloves If this Virus is so Contagious and so Deadley???

😎 If social distancing is about safety, Why is there different guidelines, in different countries??? - 2 Meters in the UK, but 1.8M, 1.5M and 1 Meter in other countries. Shouldn't it all be the same??? 

9) If covid-19 is so deadly, why has no Police officer died from the virus in England??? - When they come in close contact with general public. 

10) If covid-19 is so deadly, Why was it downgraded from a HCID back on March 19th (4days before the uk lockdown)???

Take vitamin c tablets daily and vitamin D weekly once. If you have kids in home... Try to be even more cautious...try to increase your immunity levels....

"I almost lost my stepmom in September 2019 to the most aggressive brain tumor possible. She was ok for most of the diagnosis, but what most most people don’t understand is how much it effects their memory, speech, and even movement. My mom went to more than 3 doctors and they all said she was “stressed”. So she moved on with her life. It got to the point where she couldn’t even write anything because her hand-eye coordination got so bad. So she took an MRI and found out she had a grade 4 glioblastoma brain tumor in her brain. 
I never understood how bad it was because I was young and naive. My family spent every hour of everyday helping her eat, go to the bathroom(which is hard when ur 16-17 to help clean your mom up in the bathroom) and let her live the life she deserves.

We thought the teacher was kind of crazy, 
That year NONE of her students got sick.  All of the other teachers had students with the flu, colds and stomach ailments. Some of the teachers developed skin infections from their students who had lice in their scalps.

At the same time, I got pneumonia and laryngitis. My symptoms were sore throat, dry throat, hoarse voice, red eyes. History, I have hypothyroidism, multiple times sinusitis and urinary tract infections, surgery take out gallbladder and uterus, lower back pain. 01-2018 blood tests indicated as: AST 53 U/L (11-32 U/L), ALT 159 U/L (9-43 U/L), Alkaline Phos 180 (35-129). I try the many solutions to take care of my unhealthy condition; I cannot find effective solutions. I came back to do the Herbal Remedies and acupuncture with Dr. Mat 03-2018. After I took his herbal formulas and had regular acupuncture for six months, I was totally pain-free, and the other symptoms were much better. 11-2018 my blood tests report it indicated as AST 25 U/L (11-32 U/L), ALT 17 U/L (9-43 U/L), Alkaline Phos 117 (35-129). So far, I continue to take his herbal formulas and acupuncture for almost one year, my energy is fine, my voice is fine, and I feel much healthy of my body and condition.  Thanks to Dr. Mat. 01-1-2020

I try the many solutions to take care of my unhealthy condition; I cannot find effective solutions. I came back to do the Herbal Remedies and acupuncture with Dr. Mat 03-2018. After I took his herbal formulas and had regular acupuncture for six months, I was totally pain-free, and the other symptoms were much better. 11-2018 my blood tests report it indicated as AST 25 U/L (11-32 U/L), ALT 17 U/L (9-43 U/L), Alkaline Phos 117 (35-129).

Oh btw I’m a pack a day smoker. I stilled smoked and didn’t know I had Covid. I feel better and no shortness of breath.

"Boost your immune systems & reduce inflammation in your bodies with food & supplements!!!! Majority of people have extremely low vitamin D levels, especially brown & black communities due to melanin in skin blocks sun absorption, sunblock, lack of healthy eating habits,. Get vitamin D levels checked. Start taking D3 3000-5000k units, 50 mcg Zinc (both D3 & Zinc inhibit virus replication, Fish oil Omega 3s, Vitamin A, daily (Research! Some doctors online are recommending when 
 sick taking 10,000 units for only 4 days- stops virus replication), C, E, Probiotics. Foods to incorporate in your diet if no allergies-avocados, shellfish, salmon, spinach, red peppers, kiwis, celery, blueberries, red raspberries, black berries, citrus fruits, apples, cabbage, fermented foods (kimchi, 2-4T Mother’s apple cider vinegar added to juice or salad), garlic, ginger, turmeric, onions, bone broth, greens, collard greens, OJ  & milk, almond milk, with vitamin D avocado, sunflower, flaxseed, olive oils, pumpkin/sunflower/flax/hemp/chia seeds add to yogurts, salads, tomatoes, healthy cereals or oatmeals, liver, sardines, sweet potatoes, brazilian nuts, almonds, walnuts,. Reduce red meats, cheeses (white cheese & skin are healthier), inflammatory foods (research). Stop smoking. 2 aspirin daily. Autopsy results from Italian & French doctors on Covid cases revealed blood clotting in veins which limits oxygen in blood cells!!! They said 2 aspirin daily will help prevent this issue. Research. Research. Research. Since we have no frontline defense information besides ineffective, flimsy masks & 6 ft social distancing UnConstitutional, unlawful mandates being pushed by WHO, CDC, Dr. Redfield & Dr. Fauci, Media, Leftists in Politics, Leftists Scientists, Intellectuals, Academia, Elitists. Australia per Sky News is suing over HCQ recalls & bans as frontline treatment options. A cheap, safe, known legacy drug sold over the Counter in Several Countries. No drug should be withheld, politicized, demonized under a Pandemic. The main two studies saying HCQ was dangerous & ineffective have been retracted months ago. The study was faulty. The research doctors treated elderly patients over 80 yrs old & gave them knowingly lethal doses of HCQ!!!! People conspiring on Covid19 & withholding the drug cost thousands of lives to boost spread, positive cases & death rates. peep from WHO, CDC, FDA, Mainstream Media, Dr. Redfield or Dr, Fauci. Many people &+organizations should be sued, arrested & imprisoned. Not a peep from Corporate owned Media. I wonder why?? They claim (the experts & Scientific Community) we are in a WW3 scenerio. If that’s is the case, we have no time for bicker, withhold treatment options & drugs to citizens.  When frontline doctors & nurses raw data & results indicate it works & positive results on  limiting, stopping the spread, curing patients, saving any lives it cannot be dismissed so arrogantly & recklessly. Utube Sky News on it. Also, keep hand hand sanitizer & antibacterial wipes in your car. Wipe down surfaces & your hands frequently, wash your masks,  practice proper cough & sneeze (courtesies) etiquette (inside elbow, inside shirt, directly to floor!) Teach your friends, family, students, kids & teens those tips). We do not need masks (inside & out), mandates or social distancing on healthy people, rolling shut downs. We need to fully reopen every State!!! We need diverse panels of experts in virology, Doctors, Scientists, Economic, Finance, Mental Health Experts, nurses with diverse backgrounds with common sense  approaches,  health & immunity tips, short term solutions. Experts politicized with agendas of new normals, Reset2020/2021, Reset21, Global Economic Forum agendas for 2030 & Climate Emergency Declarations, no Economic RESETS, No 3rd or 4th Industrial Revolutions (Tedtalks 2014, 2015, 2016) (Gates full Tedtalks We Are Not Ready, 2015) (Dr. Fauci 2017 full speech Surprise outbreak for Current Admin).",Positive

"Wanna make an easy free and legitimate $20? If so, follow the steps:

1) I invite you to get a PayPal Prepaid Mastercard® via email with my referral link provided in it. You scower the referral terms and obligations, limitations and advantages to having the prepaid paypal mastercard, and you decide you'd like to try it.

2) You then order a new card using my referral information, which includes my referral link, which is https://www.paypal-prepaid.com/get-a-prepaid-card/?aid=PP_RTL_RAF_1&site_id=RAF_MOB_URL&uref=5323934216 

and how you recieved my referral link, (via email); My name (Amber Hutcheson); My email address that you recieved the referral link from (amberh7875@gmail.com); And then you will need to email me with your email address and your name as well, because once you put in for the referral, or try to use my referral link, theres a chance that paypal will contact me asking if I referred you or not. They do this to ensure that you are actually my friend which is dumb. Its dumb because a new customer to them means more business, shouldnt matter if were friends or not. I think they do this to disqualify us maybe, so that they can get out of giving you and I both $20?? Anyhoe, its very crucial that you take down all of this information and provide it during sign up or the referral terms will not be fulfilled and neither of us will get our $20 referral bonus. Also, very important, make sure you dont sign up by just going to paypal.com, rather you have to make sure that you actually click on my referral link and sign up there or the referral is no good.That click is tracked by them.

3) You then activate your new Paypal debit card, once you recieve it in the mail, and then verify your identity. Often they will ask for a bank statement with your name and account number displayed on it and they dont accept statements from any non-traditional banks or prepaid accounts. They will likely ask for your social security number and a copy of your drivers license. Maybe a piece of mail with your residential address and name printed on it, as well. Ensure that you are already equipped with all of this information before proceeding, due to the fact that there is a certain number of days from which you order your card that use of my referral code is good for. Also, tere are several different free scanner, fax, and email apps in the playstore that would likely get your documents to them quicker, via your cell phone.

4) You then add at least $40.00 to your PayPal Prepaid Card, within, I believe to be 14 business days? Not totally sure, so for this reason, and in an attempt to make this whole process as seamless and successful as possible, I would just call the paypal customer service card activation number that will come with your card in the mail and have them prompt you and step you through all of the steps to ensure that it gets done right and without consuming a bunch of your time. This $40 deposit can be done via mobile upload, in store cash load, or direct deposit. I would be thorough and open with them about your intended goal and any concerns or questions you may have. 

5) You get a $20.00 credit and I get a $20.00 credit. That's it. May seem like a lot but its really not. Moreover, every bank has these very same and or similar guidelines and requirements for using referral codes and links. 

Highlight- My referral link is also educational and informative in nature, so take some time to familiarize yourself with all of the info that it provides. Dont hesitate to email me with any questions or concerns. Please like and subscribe to my video so to help me find more lucky prospective referee's like yourself and thanks so much and God bless.

I’m worried because I don’t know I have good health insurance. And I’m trying my best to get into a job to earn money because I’m only a young adult and the pandemic ripped me of most of my money.. I’ve not been to the doctors in 5 years since long before this pandemic. I don’t even have a proper doctor to go to. 

I don’t really get sick but I had a lump in the throat sensation and I coughed like twice once almost throwing up which I almost never. And since then my temperatures gone up my body feels hot but at the same time randomly I’m freezing. I think it’s chills. I’ve felt sick to my stomach too I’ve not had much of an appetite but I have ate a lot. Big meals. 

I’m not sure if it’s allergies cause allergies are the worst. I usually take Claritin. But it could also be hot flashes from puberty and my period coming up. Soooo hoping it’s just that and not something else but I am worried. Because I’ve no idea what to do to get tested.",Positive

"Hola a todos, vivo aquí en New Brunswick. Mi hijo ha tenido herpes durante 9 años. Seguimos bien las instrucciones del médico, las mantuvimos, pero aún así fue bastante vergonzoso, perdí todas las esperanzas. Hace 6 meses, por suerte, una amiga me contó sobre el doctor Aham y me contó cómo curó a un paciente de Inglaterra. que vio en YouTube usando raíces de hierbas tradicionales puras para curarla del virus. Les pedí ayuda después de gastar tanto dinero en medicamentos, encontrar una cura para la vida de mi hijo sería lo mejor para la familia. El Dr. hizo todo lo posible para ayudarme a preparar las hierbas y nos las envió aquí en Canadá, mi hijo las usó según las instrucciones. Por desgracia, en el espacio de 29 días, el virus del herpes desapareció. Mi hijo ha vuelto a la vida. Son buenas noticias para la familia. Gracias a todos, obtuve la ayuda que necesitaba. ustedes pueden obtener ayuda y también contactarlos algún día.

Day 3- sore throat (still feel like a pebble is in my throat), cough (sometimes dry, sometimes has mucus), itching eye, eyes feel dry (sometimes watering), slightly gassy

"Hola a todos, vivo aquí en New Brunswick. Mi hijo tiene herpes desde hace 9 años. Seguimos bien las instrucciones del médico, las mantuvimos, pero aún así fue bastante vergonzoso, perdí todas las esperanzas. Hace 6 meses, por suerte, una amiga me contó sobre el doctor Aham y me contó cómo curó a un paciente de Inglaterra. vio en YouTube el uso de raíces de hierbas tradicionales puras para curarla del virus. Les pedí ayuda después de gastar tanto dinero en medicamentos, encontrar una cura para la vida de mi hijo sería lo mejor para la familia. El Dr. hizo todo lo posible para ayudarme a preparar las hierbas y nos las envió aquí en Canadá, mi hijo las usó según las instrucciones. Por desgracia, en el espacio de 29 días, el virus del herpes desapareció. Mi hijo ha vuelto a la vida. Son buenas noticias para la familia. Gracias a todos, obtuve la ayuda que necesitaba. ustedes pueden obtener ayuda y también contactarlos algún día.

RNA viruses
Flavivirus
Alphavirus
Togavirus
Coronavirus
Hepatitis D
Orthomyxovirus

What it does is it targets the lipid coating disintegrates it destroying the virus.

I do not want to tell anyone what this is because it can be bought online and there are limited supplies besides no one will believe me so let us leave that as is.

"According to the official statistics, South Africa has turned into one of the greatest epicenters of Covid-19 in the world. Since the beginning of April to the 12th July, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread appeared unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million would have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That would represent 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then have dropped off steeply.  On that trend, over the first two weeks of October, between one and two million new infections were likely to occur daily.

However, on 13 July, the number of new cases dropped significantly by about 1,440, or about 11%. The day before, the 12 July 2020, sales of alcoholic beverages were prohibited in South Africa, creating a false impression that the ban was the cause of the drop in numbers. However, this is false, because the normal lag period between the introduction of a new, effective measure and its effect was completely absent, clearly identifying it as fake. This trend of a reduction of new cases continued daily and appeared to become progressively stronger. The result was that, today, 24 August, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stands at 609,773 instead of about 2.91 million, had the 'trend' of doubling every 13 or 14 days continued. There is no rational reason for a ban on liquor sales to cause such a sudden, steep drop in new cases, hence the conclusion is that, over the three-and-a-half months before 12 July, the numbers have been manipulated up, as were the numbers on recoveries. Death numbers, on the other hand, were manipulated down: https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/. 

The question is, why have the number of cases been manipulated up? 

Early this year, South Africa applied for an IMF loan of US$4.3 billion at a very low interest rate. On 27 July, the IMF publicly announced that the loan was granted -  https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic. Most likely, South Africa was informed of the grant earlier than the public announcement, perhaps around 12 July? Clearly, the numbers in South Africa have been manipulated up to impress on the IMF an urgent need for funds to fight the epidemic in the country. Most of the funds are likely to land in the pockets of corrupt people in positions of power and their family.

A further question is, what is the real motive for the ban on liquor sales? 

The answer is that the ban on liquor sales will most likely drive many liquor stores out of business. The liquor trade is seen as lucrative, easy business. White owners of such businesses are exempt on a racial basis of financial assistance to weather the covid storm, including the IMF funds. Many of these businesses are likely to go bankcupt and be bought up at bargain prices by black politicians, their family members https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true, and other black business people, perhaps using some of the IMF funds paid for other contracts where contract prices have been loaded - https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730

And https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/

The South African government is rotten through from top to bottom and doing the population a grave disservice by spreading false information to serve the aims of people in power to enrich themselves. Never miss the opportunities a good crisis offers, hey?",Positive

"Its my 14th day and I was practically asymptomatic for the first 11 days, just had a dry cough and it would barely come + weakness/fatigue and slight loss of sense of taste and smell, by day 12 after testing positive i thought i was fine and went out to get tested again but I guess my immune system was still very weak + vulnerable and I caught something else from leaving my house bc hours after getting back home I was coughing like crazy and it wasn't the dry covid cough but more of a congested cough, reminded me of the cough I had when I had bronchitis, so I assumed I got bronchitis for the third time lol but then yesterday morning, for the first time ever, I got a fever (101.1°) and hot & cold chills. Luckily Tylenol and Thermaflu tea helped me sweat out my fever and helped me fall asleep so by the time I woke up I was back to my normal body temperature. I've also been taking some medicine (prednisone 20mg + pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 30mg) and using a nebulizer mask with the machine I've had since I was a kid because of asthma and I'm feeling  A LOT better today😅😅 when I firsr got this new cough I literally could not stop coughing, just like when I've gotten bronchitis.

I don’t want it to be corona, but at the same time I kind of want it to be covid19. Cuz I don’t want to lose half of my taste cuz when I swallow my food I can feel the taste at the back of my tongue, but it’s not as strong as it used to be. And if it’s corona u usually get the sense of taste & smell back. Maybe the chest pain is due to tighten chest. But i feel pretty normal and healthy . What’s your opinion? Can they be any symptoms?

ive had it - its weird but swine flu was much worse! Ive had worse colds ffs

Dont panic and fear anxiety makes it worse, and shuts down your immune system - this helps the virus mutate more rapidly and will make you more ill - Think placebo effect your mind creates your reality,

and just a  few facts today 25,000 people died from hunger & so far this year 850k people died in car accidents.... .1.5million people died from alchohol 3.5million died from smoking

"You can buy P100 half mask respirators online. About $35 to $40 bucks. Make sure the half mask comes with P100 (magenta color filters) otherwise, you need to buy filters separately. P100 filter cartridges provide near 100% virus filtration and if you are fit tested (a specialized leak test required by OSHA), then they do provide 100%.  Make sure the half mask fits you properly. A normal adult size face will be a large size.  Women might be a medium size.  The P100 filters are HEPA filters and they will last a very long time unless you're working in a very dusty environment. They should last at least a year or so but, you can buy a pair of new filters for about $15.  Wear it when you go into any public building. It will save your life. Make sure you are clean shaven (no beards or stubble) otherwise, the mask will not seal to your face and virus can get through. Perform a positive and negative pressure check on the respirator when you first put it on (this is a basic self-seal check you can research online to ensure proper sealing). These respirators have been designed and researched by NIOSH for decades and they are required by OSHA. You can make and attach a simple, loose cloth cover for the exhalation valve to prevent coughing droplets from being released. Use caution if you have pre-existing respiratory health issues as wearing a respirator does add some resistance to normal breathing but you will find half mask respirators to be very comfortable and much easier to breathe through and cooler than most masks and face coverings because of the exhaust valve.  Make sure to keep your respirator clean inside using sanitary wipes and make sure the membrane valves are taken care of and are not damaged because they can tear easily. Store your respirator in a Ziploc bag.  Do not share your respirator with others.  Half mask respirators can be completely dismantled and cleaned but this only needs to be done occasionally.",Positive
